<Bagder>	hey adiamas
<adiamas>	hey ya...
<adiamas>	now that i have my UPS set up...
<adiamas>	im finally going to get around to get a cross compiler going :)
<Bagder>	go go go ;-)
---	You are now known as adi|home
<Bagder>	following Linus' instruction, it is really simple
<adi|home>	*nmods*
<adi|home>	only prob is im running gcc 2.95 right now :)
<Bagder>	that shouldn't matter
<Bagder>	if you have the source for that one already, you can probably make a cross compiler out of that version
<adi|home>	that reminds me...
<adi|home>	the simulator was coring on me yesterday
<adi|home>	when i shuffled the playlist
<adi|home>	i tracked it.. but it made no sense
<Bagder>	oh
<Bagder>	can you repeat it now?
<adi|home>	dunno.. was going to test in a few
<Bagder>	ok
<Bagder>	it cored yesterday when we messed around with an empty dir
<adi|home>	how do i force fstab to be reread?
<adi|home>	on linux?
<adi|home>	do you know?
<Bagder>	reread?
<Bagder>	mount -a?
<Bagder>	no, that only mounts all
<adi|home>	my prob is this..
<adi|home>	i have my archos mount with the same permissions that my floppy does
<adi|home>	at least thats what the fstab tells me
<adi|home>	i can mount the floppy as a user, but not the archos
<dwihno>	you have the nouser flag?
<adi|home>	nope
<adi|home>	/dev/sda1               /mnt/archos             vfat    noauto,owner	0 0
<Bagder>	ok, so you changed that but the user still can do it?
<adi|home>	no...
<adi|home>	as a user i can mount my floppy, but as a user i cannot mount my archos
<adi|home>	and my floppy entry is the same
<adi|home>	/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy             auto    noauto,owner    0 0
<Bagder>	I just use umask=0 and am happy with that ;-)
<adi|home>	heheh
<Bagder>	/dev/sda1               /mnt/archos             vfat    noauto,umask=0  0 0
<adi|home>	ill try it :)
<Bagder>	that still requires root to mount
<Bagder>	but any user can write to it
<adi|home>	see.. don't want that :)
<adi|home>	i want user to be able to mount it :)
<Bagder>	beats me really
<adi|home>	hehe no worries
<adi|home>	yup.. still happens .. the coring..
<adi|home>	can you check on your version and ensure im not nuts?
<Bagder>	sure
<dwihno>	you're full of the nuts? :)
<adi|home>	okay... load the uizim
<adi|home>	the sim
<adi|home>	then load a playlist
<adi|home>	then go to shuffle the list and shuffle
<adi|home>	and it should core after it finishes
<Bagder>	ok... fixing my darned X-redirect...
*	adi|home screams
<adi|home>	my rockbox on the archos reboots.. even with the dc plugged in
<adi|home>	wtf
<Bagder>	ugh
<adi|home>	ugh what?
<adi|home>	the logo looks sharp though :)
<Bagder>	ugh as in "oh that is not nice"
<Bagder>	hehe
<adi|home>	hehe and my icons look sweet :)
<Bagder>	they do
<adi|home>	hehehe screen saver on the rockbox... 
<adi|home>	sooooooo cool :)
<Bagder>	:-)
<adi|home>	god i love this
<dwihno>	are there icons now?
*	adi|home nods
<Bagder>	it doesn't crash for me
<adi|home>	there always were.. we just wernet using them
<adi|home>	hmmm wtf...
<adi|home>	i did a make clean
<adi|home>	and a cvs update
<dwihno>	adi|home: Show me a screenshot! :D
<adi|home>	of the icons?
<adi|home>	sure.. give me a min
<Bagder>	adi|home: can you show me a stack trace?
<dwihno>	yay! :D
<adi|home>	sure.. give me a min
<adi|home>	doing an update and recompile just in case
<adi|home>	dwihno.. you have dcc on?
<dwihno>	Yuppers
---	Offering sshot.jpg to dwihno
<adi|home>	okay.. bagder.. how do i get you a stack trace?
<adi|home>	strace?
<adi|home>	right?
<Bagder>	run 'gdb rockboxui core'
<Bagder>	then 'where'
<Bagder>	(or 'bt' if you prefer a shortcut ;-)
<adi|home>	no stack
<dwihno>	adi|home: How cute! :D
<adi|home>	heh wait.. im stupid
<dwihno>	the cursor should be replaced
<Bagder>	dwihno: yes indeed
<adi|home>	okay.. then what bagder?
<adi|home>	i know where is choking on mine.. i just don't know why.
<dwihno>	I'll draw one rightaway ;D
<Bagder>	mail it to me, daniel@haxx.se
<Bagder>	please do
<dwihno>	How big is the font btw?
<adi|home>	want me to just dcc it to you?
<Bagder>	adi|home: I'm tunneled, bounced, crawled and sneaked so much dcc is impossible ;-)
<adi|home>	hehhe okay
<dwihno>	5x7?
<Bagder>	yes
<adi|home>	sent
<adi|home>	something else i was thinking...
<adi|home>	we can 'shuffle' and empty list
<Bagder>	got it
<adi|home>	we should be checking that
<adi|home>	namely.. if you havne't loaded a list, tell the user that
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	I told Zagor so too
<dwihno>	.....
<dwihno>	##...
<dwihno>	###..
<dwihno>	####.
<dwihno>	###..
<dwihno>	##...
<dwihno>	.....
<dwihno>	There, a new cursor ;)
<Bagder>	adi|home: there's no stack trace there!
<Bagder>	dwihno: now convert it to bytes, LSB in the top, each column one byte
<Bagder>	and use the 5 bytes width
<Bagder>	5 pixels
<dwihno>	LSB?
<Bagder>	least significant bit
<Bagder>	bit 0
<dwihno>	Line 1: 0, line 2: 3 ?
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	column-wise
<dwihno>	mkay
<Bagder>	column 0; 0x7e
<Bagder>	adi|home: this dump just shows lots of loaded symbols and the actual crash point, no stack trace
<Bagder>	try running it with gdb from the start:
<Bagder>	'gdb rockboxui'
<Bagder>	'run'
<Bagder>	[booom]
<Bagder>	'bt'
<adi|home>	k
<adi|home>	what is bt?
<Bagder>	back trace
<adi|home>	k.. all it returns is: 
<adi|home>	#0  0x0804e10f in menu_run (m=Cannot access memory at address 0x3d099dcc
<adi|home>	) at ../../apps/menu.c:169
<adi|home>	Cannot access memory at address 0x3d099dc4
<adi|home>	and i could have told you that
<Bagder>	hm
<adi|home>	i found out that much last night.. exactly where it is dieing.. but now why
<adi|home>	its the menu_redraw
<adi|home>	in main_menu.c
<adi|home>	when you return from the function ptr
<dwihno>	Bagder: 0x3e, 0x3e, 0x1c, 8, 0
<Bagder>	dwihno: you should use the full 5x7
<Bagder>	we have 6x8 
<dwihno>	we have?
<Bagder>	yes
<dwihno>	mkay
<dwihno>	me stupid
<dwihno>	me back in a flash soon ;)
<Bagder>	no ;-)
<dwihno>	me need coffee
<Bagder>	menu_redraw?
<adi|home>	yup.. one sec ill get you a line
*	Bagder runs to fill up more coffee
<adi|home>	sorry.. menu_draw
<adi|home>	menu.c:164
<adi|home>	               lcd_clear_display();
<adi|home>	            
<adi|home>	                menus[m].items[menus[m].cursor].function();
<adi|home>	            
<adi|home>	                /* Return to previous display state */
<adi|home>	                menu_draw(m);
<adi|home>	                break;
<adi|home>	the function call goes fine
<adi|home>	"m" is valid before the call
-->	Zagor (~bjst@as9-5-6.k.s.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<adi|home>	all looks fine in he call
<adi|home>	we return and _barf_
<Zagor>	hi all
<adi|home>	hey zagor
<adi|home>	found a nice core that Bagder cant seem to repeat
<Zagor>	ooh, shiny! :)
*	adi|home nods
<dwihno>	0x7e, 0x7e, 0x7e, 0x3c, 0x3c, 0x18
<dwihno>	0x7e, 0x42, 0x42, 0x24, 0x24, 0x18 (for a "transparent" version) ;)
<adi|home>	zagor.. 
<dwihno>	what's the opposite of LSB term-wise?
<adi|home>	know how the archos works better when you have dc plugged in?
<Zagor>	dwihno: msb
<dwihno>	mkay
*	dwihno suck when it comes to buzzwording :)
<adi|home>	nah. your just 'Livt'
<dwihno>	Add my cursor code :)
<Hadaka>	don't mix those with big-endian and little-endian like some people do :)
<Bagder>	dwihno: in progress
<adi|home>	at least your not a 'Liar'
<dwihno>	Hadaka: what's the diff between big and little-endian? /me has always been on the intel platform...
<Hadaka>	well intel is the stupid one :)
<adi|home>	the size of the feather
<dwihno>	adi|home: haw haw haw
<dwihno>	Hadaka: so what is the difference?
<adi|home>	smiles broadley
<dwihno>	word order?
<dwihno>	Tell me
<Hadaka>	byte order in words
<Hadaka>	little endian is
<Hadaka>	A B C D
<Hadaka>	big endian is B A D C
<Hadaka>	if I'm not tripping, it's too early in the morning
<Hadaka>	(that's bytes)
<Zagor>	you are tripping :)
<dwihno>	C D A B ?
<adi|home>	heheh
<adi|home>	but he's right isn't he?
*	adi|home remebers it that way
<Zagor>	no, big-endian is straight big-to-small. little-endian is twisted
*	adi|home taps Hadaka on the shoulder and askes if he is a he, just in case
<Hadaka>	err, big-endian is small-to-big
<Hadaka>	yup, sorry guys, I'm male
<adi|home>	so big should be: D C B A
<Hadaka>	or
<Hadaka>	if you are guys }:>
<adi|home>	and little is: C D A B
<adi|home>	?
<Hadaka>	adi|home: nope
<Hadaka>	I hope that is
<Zagor>	the lowest byte of a big-endian word is the highest value
<Zagor>	0xCAFEF00D is 0xCA 0xFE 0xF0 0x0D
<dwihno>	Bagder: Is the cursor cute?
<Bagder>	not quite there yet
<dwihno>	oh..
<adi|home>	little: 0x0D 0xF0 0xFE 0xCA?
<Hadaka>	hmh, lowest? do you mean 0xCA with that or 0x0D?
<Zagor>	i meant lowest address
<Zagor>	0xCA
<Hadaka>	hm, yeah
<Hadaka>	oh yeah
*	adi|home is confused again
<dwihno>	Little endian is gay, in that case
*	adi|home needs to go back and read
<adi|home>	given CAFEFOOD
<adi|home>	what is little?
<Hadaka>	big-endian assumption being that the highest address should be highest value - which is wrong
<Hadaka>	s/big/my big/;
<Zagor>	Hadaka: ah
<Hadaka>	jesus one should never run into these things
<dwihno>	Hmm
<dwihno>	For someone who knows nothing on this endian stuff, who should I listen to so I won't learn the wrong stuff? :)
<Bagder>	haha
<Zagor>	hehe
<adi|home>	lotsa pot smokers in belguim must be happy :)
<adi|home>	hehe Zagor
<adi|home>	he's been right so far in everything else :)
<dwihno>	heh
<Zagor>	:)
<dwihno>	Zagor: Give me a skolboksexample, s'il vous plait :)
<Hadaka>	http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/b/big_endian.html
<Zagor>	little endian cafefood is just the opposite: 0x0D 0xF0 0xFE 0xCA
<Hadaka>	haha
<Hadaka>	UNIX -> NUXI - 'U' 'N' 'I' 'X' is big endian, 'N' 'U' 'X' 'I' is little endian :)
<dwihno>	So when will one be affected by endianness? And don't tell me some apache joke now adi ;)
<Bagder>	dwihno: reading binary data as 'shorts' or 'longs' etc
<Zagor>	Hadaka: yes but only when talking about two 16-bit words. if it was 32-bit, it'd be XINU
<Bagder>	dwihno: like when reading a BMP file from disk ;-)
<dwihno>	Hehe...
<dwihno>	I bet 'my' BMP reader will freak out with little endian
<dwihno>	big endian on the archos?
<dwihno>	oops
<dwihno>	well, you know what I mean ;)
<Zagor>	yes, except some hardware (like the ata controller) is little endian
<dwihno>	eww
<dwihno>	endian soup
<Zagor>	and the mp3 chip is little-endian bit-wise, so we have to flip every single friggin byte before we send it...
<dwihno>	They should have chosen a big-endian mp3 decoding chip
<Zagor>	yeah, well there's a list of "they should've"s :)
<adi|home>	starting with 'they should've made the price cheaper'
<dwihno>	They should have made the screen 400x200 pixels :)
<dwihno>	What is the most power consuming part (apart from the hard disk stuff) ?
<Zagor>	i don't know. cpu, i guess
<adi|home>	okay.. just to double check...
<adi|home>	ABCD in big indian
<adi|home>	is 
<adi|home>	CDAB in little?
<Zagor>	if the data is two 16-bit words, yes
<Zagor>	if it's one 32-bit word, it will be DCBA
<adi|home>	k...
<adi|home>	and if you have 2 32 bit words of ABCD ABCD?
<adi|home>	or ABCD EFGH
<Zagor>	DCBA HGFE
<adi|home>	russian belguim game has gotten really good :)
*	dwihno is amazed by the stupidity of some people
<dwihno>	Encoding stuff @ 192kbps even when the quality is really bad
<Bagder>	hehe, I found something...
<Bagder>	#define MAX_MENUS 4
<Bagder>	in apps/menu.c
<adi|home>	hehehe okay?
<adi|home>	thats why we core?
<Bagder>	yeah
<Zagor>	you made a new menu?
<adi|home>	damn.. how did you find that?
<adi|home>	hey.. they added shuffle playlist
<Zagor>	as a new menu? not just an entry?
<adi|home>	no.. its an entry..
<adi|home>	so that shouldn't effect it
<Bagder>	this is an entry count
<Zagor>	MAX_MENUS is the max menu depth, not max entries
*	adi|home nods
<Bagder>	then it is used wrongly
<Zagor>	ok
<Bagder>	check main_menu.c 
<Bagder>	and the menu_init() call
<Zagor>	checking
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	sorry
<Bagder>	my bad
<Bagder>	no problem there
<Zagor>	ok
<adi|home>	zagor.. 
<Zagor>	yup?
<adi|home>	can you explain why 32 bit words become DCBA HGFE
<adi|home>	seems more sensible that it would be EFGH ABCD
<adi|home>	or GHEF CDAB
<Zagor>	your data is 64 bits
*	adi|home nods
<dwihno>	aaaaaaaaarggghhh!
<dwihno>	you make me go nuts! :)
<Zagor>	so it's split up in two 32-bit words
<adi|home>	right
<Zagor>	the words don't change places or anything
<Zagor>	the byte swapping is only done within the word
<adi|home>	okay...
<adi|home>	why doen'st the same idea follo for 16bit works?
<adi|home>	words?
<adi|home>	you said: ABCD becomes CDAB
<adi|home>	if the swap is within words.. wouldnt: BADC make more sense?
<Bagder>	"word" is a crappy term to use
<Zagor>	i didn't say that, did I? it's wrong
<Zagor>	32-bit ABCD becomes DCBA
<Zagor>	16-bit ABCD becomes BADC
<dwihno>	Bagder: the daily build is already built?
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	6 am MET
<dwihno>	darn
<dwihno>	Then I'll wait until tomorrow ;)
<dwihno>	We need a "select cursor" menu ;D
<Bagder>	I'll just fix the cursor for the tree browser too and soon we'll see
<adi|home>	can i assum then that on 64 bit words we would be: ABCDEFGH => HGFE DCBA?
*	Bagder tries to figure out the best way to deal with the margins in the tree browser
<Zagor>	adi|home: yes
*	adi|home is finally getting this
<adi|home>	thank you for the help...
<Zagor>	Bagder: what is your problem with margins?
<Zagor>	no problem
<Zagor>	btw, adi, whatever happened to your logging effort?
*	adi|home whistles innocently
*	Bagder chuckles
<adi|home>	my isp decided to get alot more unstable
<adi|home>	we need a bot in here to just sit and suck everything up
<Zagor>	i'd still say you're the guy with the most complete logs. you're always here
*	adi|home blushes
<adi|home>	i can put up what i haver right now
<Zagor>	yeah, that is an option
<Zagor>	please do
<dwihno>	Hey, what happened to privacy?!
<dwihno>	ECHELON SEES YOU! :D
<adi|home>	that doesn't exist on the net ;)
<Bagder>	 /whois privacy
<Bagder>	oops ;-)
<dwihno>	ECHELON BUSH TALIBAN USAMA BIN LADEN {{{{{ hugs to you }}}}}
<adi|home>	my current rockbox log is 1.1 megs
<dwihno>	There, my footprint in the internet world ;D
<Zagor>	adi|home: will you split it up into days?
<adi|home>	all i ahve to say is that PRESIDENT BUSH is the BOMB and bin laden needs to DIE
<adi|home>	for you zag?
<adi|home>	sure
<adi|home>	but only cause its you
<Zagor>	hehe
*	adi|home winks suggestivly
<Zagor>	nudge nudge
<adi|home>	nudge nudge... wink wink.. kno what i mean.. know what i mean...
<adi|home>	have you ever.. have ya hu? have you...
<adi|home>	ya know...
<Bagder>	there we go again ;-)
<dwihno>	find / -name bin | awk '{print $1 " laden"}'
*	adi|home yells out 'Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
<adi|home>	Zagor.. should i remove room enters and leaving?
*	Bagder thinks so
<Zagor>	yes
<dwihno>	and everything dwihno-related. I want my privacy ;D
<Bagder>	dwihno: your privacy can be found here => #dwinos_secrets
<Bagder>	set it invite-only ;-)
<dwihno>	:D
<dwihno>	Mr. Funny pants
<dwihno>	http://www.klitta.nu/dw/keops_bigapple.png
<dwihno>	Speaking of funny pants
<Bagder>	someone could make some work on a vertical slider
<Bagder>	if we should have one
<dwihno>	hmm
<dwihno>	It could share space with the cursor
<dwihno>	I like the display like it is now - as many filenames as possible! :)
*	Bagder commits new cursor
<dwihno>	YAY! :D
<dwihno>	Which did you chose?
<Bagder>	0x7e, 0x7e, 0x7e, 0x3c, 0x3c, 0x18
<Bagder>	but it looks a bit ugly ;-)
<Bagder>	too thick
<dwihno>	ugly cursor for ugly people
<dwihno>	shift it left one step and make the new first column smaller than
<dwihno>	then
<Bagder>	I thought about that too
<Bagder>	perhaps even two steps
<dwihno>	do so
<Bagder>	 0x7f, 0x3e, 0x1c, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00 wins
<Bagder>	Zagor: does the scroll code care about the lcd margins on the recorder?
<Zagor>	yes
<dwihno>	Bagder: yay!
<dwihno>	does the scroll look fishy on the players?
<Zagor>	no that I know
<Zagor>	not
<Bagder>	the new cursor only uses 4 pixels width
<adi|home>	zagor.. your gonna love me in a min :)
<dwihno>	I'll start working on a variable width font this weekend
*	Zagor feels his heart warming
<Zagor>	dwihno: cool
<Bagder>	dwihno: it would be really cool
<dwihno>	How are you storing the fonts right now?
<Zagor>	Bagder: have you kept my code that handles proportional fonts?
<dwihno>	like the cursor?
<Bagder>	Zagor: I think I have it somewhere, yes
<dwihno>	I was thinking about an extra byte for w&h
<Bagder>	dwihno: I adjusted it
<Bagder>	I added a bug when scrolling in the tree browser though :-/
<dwihno>	So what are the measurements we should keep?
<dwihno>	Bagder: It's called a surprise feature, not bug :)
<Zagor>	as small as possible :)
<dwihno>	<reboot> SURPRISE! :D
<dwihno>	How about umlauts and special chars?
<Zagor>	yes please
<Zagor>	a full iso 8859-1 is ideal
<Bagder>	heck, this bugs more than just in the scroll
<dwihno>	I'll work against the charmap in the recorder...
<Bagder>	more coffee needed
*	dwihno is not looking forward to the 1 o'clock meeting
<dwihno>	meetings are time thieves
<Zagor>	dwihno: either that, or look here: http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859-1.gif
<adi|home>	okay.. irc files updated
<adi|home>	but you ge to fix the html ;)
<adi|home>	im going to bed
<Zagor>	ok, bye
<Bagder>	night adi
<Bagder>	now you can try the new cursor
<Bagder>	hm
<Bagder>	brb
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
-->	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	http://storebror.haxx.se/archos/
<Bagder>	brand new
<dwihno>	I'll test it rightaway
<adi|home>	ummm.. don't mean to be an ass ;)
<adi|home>	but the cursor you just put in..
<adi|home>	is exactly like the Selector that was there and not being used :)
<Bagder>	haha
<dwihno>	adi|home: you're an ass :)
*	Bagder is blind
<adi|home>	don't blame me...
<adi|home>	_you_ didnt read the code ;)(
<dwihno>	Heh
<dwihno>	So what? :)
<dwihno>	I'm no coder
<dwihno>	I just come with ideas
<adi|home>	hehehe
<adi|home>	im just bustig your balls.. 
<Bagder>	but... but... eh, but my cursor is one more pixel to the left! ;-)
<dwihno>	:D
<adi|home>	besides.. yours looks sharper for some reason
<adi|home>	hehehe
<adi|home>	keep yours
<adi|home>	delete Selector
<dwihno>	YOUR cursor?! :/
*	dwihno is offended
<adi|home>	your.. meaning you ddi the new one didn you ?
<Bagder>	haha
*	adi|home runs to bed
<dwihno>	erhm
<Bagder>	dwihno: compare the values, they aren't really the ones you gave me ;-)
<dwihno>	they are not! 
<dwihno>	oh my god!
<dwihno>	You evil dude
<dwihno>	the lcd still flickers
<Bagder>	I pulled up xmag and zoomed in
<Bagder>	and this setup was the nicest I could do
<adi|home>	no it don't.. you just blink funny
<dwihno>	and the [browse] line should be removed since another line of files would fit ;D
<Zagor>	actually I think that's a good idea. we want to use the screen fully
<dwihno>	What is the dimensions of the screen?
<adi|home>	well.. remember
<adi|home>	your going to want battery indicators

<Zagor>	adi|home: agreed, but personally I prefer such information on a separate info screen
<dwihno>	Me too
<Zagor>	or during playback or something. not in the browser
<dwihno>	browser is a browser
<dwihno>	during playback, there is a lot of space for displaying such information

<dwihno>	Will there be L/R volume bars in the future?
<Zagor>	you mean during playback?
<dwihno>	yeah
<Zagor>	no thanks...
<dwihno>	I mean, it's not that pretty
<dwihno>	and it looks rather silly when only updated a couple of times per secnod
<Zagor>	yes
<Zagor>	i don't like it either
<dwihno>	A wider battery might be nice too
<Zagor>	i say we skip the silly icon and use hard numbers instead
<dwihno>	%?
<Zagor>	yeah
<dwihno>	Yeah, and a "time left" feature :D
<dwihno>	(or, at least, some kind of estimation)
<Zagor>	that's, ummm, difficult
<Zagor>	even just % is very difficult
<dwihno>	it is?
<dwihno>	Does not the hardware supply the values?
<dwihno>	Or do you have to pull off a sw trick to read it?
<Zagor>	the hardware supplies battery voltage, that's all
<dwihno>	hm
<dwihno>	voltage, as in 1.2 volts?
<Zagor>	yes
<dwihno>	oh
<dwihno>	Mail the archos guys and ask them :)
<Zagor>	heh, yeah right :)
<dwihno>	"Hello mr. archos guy. How do you perform the battery check? We think battery status would be neat in Rockbox"
<Bagder>	would be cool to get an external meter on that thing and keep showing the voltage all the way until the unit dies

<[TOT]Maverick>	hi
<[TOT]Maverick>	Just tried out the new daily build for the recorder
<[TOT]Maverick>	Dunno if you already know but the Euro-Symbol doesnt work it just displays a ?.
<Zagor>	yeah, we lack a number of symbols in the font
<[TOT]Maverick>	Hehe
<[TOT]Maverick>	I used it for DJ DEEP the both EEs were Euros
<dwihno>	Oh how neat
<[TOT]Maverick>	:)
<[TOT]Maverick>	Tetris is nice
<Zagor>	hehe, yeah. a little diversion while you... eh... don't listen to music (yet) :)
<[TOT]Maverick>	But I hate these buttons they arent like the ones of a gameboy or something
<[TOT]Maverick>	who needs music on a mp3 player :)
<[TOT]Maverick>	First i also thought about reporting the scrolling bug but you fixed it first :)
<Zagor>	hehe
<[TOT]Maverick>	Hehe developers are faster in fixing bugs than user in reporting em
<[TOT]Maverick>	BTW Music in tetris would be nice
<Zagor>	the music will keep playing during tetris. just fire up a big playlist and you'll be set
<Zagor>	did you try loading a playlist, btw? i think you will be pleasantly surprised...
<[TOT]Maverick>	No i never use playlist *beatme*
<Zagor>	i know, the archos playlists aren't very useful. we're changing all that
<[TOT]Maverick>	hehe
<[TOT]Maverick>	You dont understand
<[TOT]Maverick>	I NEVER use em :)
<[TOT]Maverick>	Not in winamp, not on the box..
<Zagor>	how are you using it? playing a record at a time, or having all songs in one dir?
<[TOT]Maverick>	my songs are too long fo puttin them into a list
<Zagor>	too long?
<[TOT]Maverick>	i usually listen to mixes about 300mins long a track
<Zagor>	ah, ok
<[TOT]Maverick>	so there is no need for mee
<Zagor>	so what you really want is mid-track resume
<[TOT]Maverick>	but of course for normal songs its quite useful
<[TOT]Maverick>	yeah THAT would be usefeul for ME :)
<Zagor>	it's coming in a later version
<[TOT]Maverick>	Shouldnt be too hard to realize, nor?
<Zagor>	not really. the scary part is writing on the harddisk... :-)
<[TOT]Maverick>	hmmm
<[TOT]Maverick>	Perhaps you could use a hidden directory for saving data
<[TOT]Maverick>	OR use the MBR!!!
<Zagor>	exactly
<datazone>	right..
<[TOT]Maverick>	That would be an option
<Zagor>	we'll use a sector before the FAT
<[TOT]Maverick>	yeah so its hidden in windows
<Zagor>	yup
<[TOT]Maverick>	nice
<Zagor>	and so we don't have to look for it in a directory, we always know where to save
<[TOT]Maverick>	erm the UI gets more graphically as development moves on?
<Zagor>	yes
<[TOT]Maverick>	nice
<[TOT]Maverick>	is a graphical indocator like the one in winamp possible when playing a song?
<[TOT]Maverick>	The current one of the archos is just for left-right...
<Zagor>	it's not easy, since we don't unpack the data ourselves
<[TOT]Maverick>	ah
<[TOT]Maverick>	that does the dsp
<Zagor>	yes
<[TOT]Maverick>	ok so no chance there
<Zagor>	I wouldn't say no chance, but it's not straight-forward
<[TOT]Maverick>	I noticed something when text is scrolling at a faster speed...
<[TOT]Maverick>	Its like the effect on a TFT screen
<[TOT]Maverick>	when something moves fast
<Zagor>	yeah, trail
<[TOT]Maverick>	But never seen that on a LCD before.
<[TOT]Maverick>	is that normal?
<Zagor>	yes. lcd screens are inherently slow
<[TOT]Maverick>	gameboy didnt have that "feature" :)
<Zagor>	maybe their screen was faster
<[TOT]Maverick>	But its nice to set your own speed
<[TOT]Maverick>	great work there
<Zagor>	thanks
<[TOT]Maverick>	Will you implement functions like renaming, moving an so on?
<datazone>	why dont you look on the webpage
<datazone>	it lists the wishlist of features
<Zagor>	yes, probably. but it's a bit in the future
<[TOT]Maverick>	@data: I look at the page every day just to mention.
<datazone>	every day?  man, thats bad
*	Bagder made the build go yellow... fixing...
<Zagor>	booo! :)
<[TOT]Maverick>	I like the site
<[TOT]Maverick>	Every day something new :)
<datazone>	or you have "issues"
<Zagor>	ironi made the design, I make everything else :)
<Zagor>	yeah I try to keep it interesting
<[TOT]Maverick>	It IS
<[TOT]Maverick>	But there is one thing i miss since ver 1.0
<Zagor>	what is that?
<[TOT]Maverick>	The Status of the single parts
<Bagder>	we need a new table
<Bagder>	with new parts
<datazone>	i remember when i first saw the rockbox logo.. heh, i though it was a guy humping the "R"
<Zagor>	well we don't really have that kind of progress anymore. most new features affect many parts
<[TOT]Maverick>	hmmm
<Bagder>	we could still list things we want, what we work on and what isn't worked on
<Zagor>	Bagder: true
<[TOT]Maverick>	yeah thats what i mean
<[TOT]Maverick>	the user doesnt interest what is REALLY done wherever
<[TOT]Maverick>	BTW² will it be possible in the future to make mods or plugins?
<Zagor>	no, we'll always make whole apps
<[TOT]Maverick>	ok
<Zagor>	we do plan a boot selector, though
<Bagder>	but we'll do different apps
<[TOT]Maverick>	So you have to make a nice (and nice looking hehe) app :)
<Bagder>	well, with the proper help and feedback, we'll end up there
<[TOT]Maverick>	I am always there if you are in need of ideas
*	Bagder enables picky warnings in the simulator builds now
<[TOT]Maverick>	But as you already know i cant "really" help you because of my non existing c knowledge

<Bagder>	check the compile stat table
<Bagder>	suggestion on the link?
<Zagor>	a - instead of space
<Zagor>	and link to a subdir that I can symlink to your dir
<Bagder>	hm
<Bagder>	ok
<Bagder>	I prefer to use %20 and keep the same
<Bagder>	space
<Bagder>	it is the same time stamp
<Zagor>	ok
<Bagder>	name of your symlink?
<Zagor>	cvslog ?
<Zagor>	cvsmod maybe?
<Bagder>	there
<Bagder>	it should link to my output dir
<Zagor>	where are your files?
<Bagder>	/home/dast/rockbox-auto/output
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	works
<Bagder>	neato
<Bagder>	the dump shows the last 25 minutes
<Bagder>	it makes 5 minute overlap
<Zagor>	hmm, is that what we want?
<Bagder>	well, entirely without overlap tends to be with gap instead
<Bagder>	this is just time-based
<Zagor>	yes, but can't you look at the time and minimise the gap? it will get confusing when one change is in two status logs
<Bagder>	I can minimize it, sure
<Bagder>	but since I select based on time, I either risk overlap or gap, making it *perfect* is not really realistic

<Bagder>	actually, I usually have just 1600x1200
<elinenbe>	the mobile ATI actually has better benchmarks

<dwihno>	Of course :)
<Bagder>	matrox
<elinenbe>	matrox is not known for games.
<dwihno>	But unless you run 3d-games at a high res, 32 meg should be sufficient, right?
<elinenbe>	yeah

<dwihno>	Then I started using mingw
<elinenbe>	is that better or something?
<dwihno>	UT - 15" TFT UXGA (1600x1200)
<Bagder>	mingw uses the MS native C lib

<elinenbe>	what is the cost difference?
<elinenbe>	well, remember a laptop is really NEVER upgradable.  so what you buy now, you should expect to be happy with for at least 3 or 4 years.
<dwihno>	$70
<elinenbe>	it is probably better to shell out a little more now.  If you get the 32 megs and you are not happy, then what do you do?

<g003y>	heya elinenbe
<elinenbe>	hey there.
<elinenbe>	you are compiling under cygwin -- right?
<g003y>	yeah
<elinenbe>	can you step me through it really fast.  when you install cygwin do what options did you check?
<elinenbe>	I could not get it to compile today -- it told me I was missing the header files.
<elinenbe>	string.h
<elinenbe>	stdio.h
<elinenbe>	etc...
<g003y>	oh
<g003y>	did you install gcc with cygwin?
<elinenbe>	yeah
<elinenbe>	I should not do that -- right?
<g003y>	no.
<elinenbe>	what packages should I select?
<g003y>	you need gcc to get to the cross compiled one
<g003y>	I don't think it's a package issue
<g003y>	string.h is standard lib
<elinenbe>	well, then binutils asks for a cc compiler?
<elinenbe>	yeah I know.
<g003y>	you may have to mod that make for binutils then
<elinenbe>	how did you do it?
<g003y>	I'm trying to recall the steps in my crusty brain here :D
<g003y>	I'm not near my install
<elinenbe>	I am going to do a default cygwin install...
<g003y>	yeah but I encountered the cc problem you had
<elinenbe>	oh.
<elinenbe>	I should install cygwin without gcc -- right?
<g003y>	I know I have a solution.  I believe I edited the makefile and changed CC=cc to CC=gcc
<elinenbe>	oh... ok
<g003y>	no you need an initial gcc to get things done
<elinenbe>	then I should install gcc?
<g003y>	yeah
<g003y>	then you update it when you do Zagor's instructions
<elinenbe>	ok, so I am installing cygwin default, with gcc
<g003y>	don't forget make as well
<g003y>	 :D
<elinenbe>	ok.
<elinenbe>	which make.
<g003y>	the make proggy
<elinenbe>	I am just doing the standard configure/make/make install
<g003y>	I'm sure it installs by default
<elinenbe>	well, I will tell you.
<g003y>	the missing string.h is probably a pathing issue you're having
<elinenbe>	well, it was there in /usr/include
<g003y>	yeah but on mine it wouldn't find it with cygwin for some reason
<g003y>	I had to put it right into the makefiles that required it
<g003y>	then compiles worked
<elinenbe>	what do you mean you had to put it right into the make file?
<elinenbe>	the path?
<g003y>	yeah
<g003y>	-I/usr/include
<g003y>	then compiles worked
<elinenbe>	oh... ok
<elinenbe>	well, that is all I think I needed to do then
<g003y>	for some reason it doesn't pick it up
<g003y>	oh ok
<g003y>	well then try that :D
<elinenbe>	everything was compiling okay, except that.
<g003y>	oh
<g003y>	then you're far enough along that it's probably that bit
<g003y>	I haven't gone back to shell setup to figure it out as it's easy enough to put that extra include in the Makefiles.

<Bagder>	read the first change mentioned ;-)
<edx>	LOL
<edx>	*compiling*
<edx>	one unresolved external... :)
<edx>	what file is this/
<edx>	?
<Bagder>	current_tick, right?
<edx>	sure hehe
<edx>	what file is it in and what shall it do?
<Bagder>	I "fake" it, check uisim/x11/thread.c
<Bagder>	just increase it every now and then ;-)
<edx>	k
<Bagder>	in target it is incremented by the timer interrupt
<edx>	in what timespan is the interrupt called
<Bagder>	I'm not sure, but it might be something like 50ms between
<edx>	when do you increase it?
<Bagder>	on yield() and on sleep()
<Bagder>	I just add 3 in yeild and 5 in sleep()
<edx>	aha
<Bagder>	just to make it continue "growing"
<edx>	ill set up a timer :)
<edx>	hmm this is a variable or a function (just a variable, right?)
<Bagder>	you could do that, if you think that'll be more fun ;-)
<Bagder>	just a variable, yes
<edx>	more code more fun lol
<Bagder>	hehe
<edx>	where is current_tick declared (header file..)?
<Bagder>	kernel.h
<edx>	(ok.. works)
<Bagder>	neato
<edx>	hey cool.. the scroll character for the recorder changed. nice
<Bagder>	yeah
<Bagder>	I never liked using only a minus
<edx>	for the player its a questionmark on the simulator... is that correct ?!
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	we should fix that too
<Bagder>	it's a special character on the target
<edx>	ok
<Bagder>	we just don't have that in the simulator charset
<Bagder>	seen the new link on the compile status table too?
<edx>	.. no?
<Bagder>	it makes it easy to see which changes that were committed just before the automatic build
<edx>	changelog you mean?
<edx>	that is great
<Bagder>	no I meant down in the "CVS compile status" table
<Bagder>	the "batch" dates are now links
<edx>	cool.. it colors warnings :)
<Bagder>	yeps
<edx>	.. could you do me a favour?
<Bagder>	sure, what?

<edx>	broken my build again?! hehe
<Bagder>	heh, no, I made it nicer ;-)
<Bagder>	fixed the cursor on the simulated player
<edx>	(my build?!) hehe... 
<edx>	ah cool
<edx>	thats good
<Bagder>	should work fine for you too
<edx>	hmm we should add win32 simulator for the daily page :)
<edx>	but i see no way how this would be possible :/
<Bagder>	there's no x11 simulator build daily either
<Bagder>	only automaticly for the build status one
<Bagder>	maybe that's what you meant?
<edx>	yea
<edx>	but theres a report for the sim
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	it's easy to build automaticly
<edx>	and why is there a P-Old sim.. thats the same as p-sim, right?
<Bagder>	hehe, yes it should be pretty much exactly the same ;-)
<edx>	(why is tehre a p-old at all.. its only one step)
<Bagder>	p-old has a different lcd
<edx>	oh.. ok
<Bagder>	that's why
<edx>	maybe i could provide a daily build page for the win32 simulator on my server.
<Bagder>	sure!
<edx>	but i couldn't get it update automatically i guess (i could update it everytime i change something)
<Bagder>	but then we won't see it break if someone else change something...
<edx>	hmm yea
<edx>	the problem is that my server doesnt have visual studio installed...
<edx>	.. well i have an idea.. but it needs a testing.. maybe i could get it to work
<edx>	it would need to checkout, compile, generate a webpage...
<edx>	that's gets less and less a problem the more i think about it
<edx>	be right back.

<dw|gone>	what about fixing broken code? :)
<Bagder>	nah, not as fun
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	like what code are you referring to?

*	Bagder grins
<dw|gone>	really neat :)
<Bagder>	and they fly! ;-)
<dw|gone>	How come the directory browsing is 100 times faster with rockbox?
<Bagder>	no idea
<dw|gone>	I mean, when entering new dirs
<Bagder>	they must be doing something terrible
<dw|gone>	yeah
<dw|gone>	and the scroller still scrolls when going across dirs :)
<dw|gone>	If the LCD flickering stops and we get mp3 decoding, I'll start using it rightaway :)
<Bagder>	I agree
<dw|gone>	pok?mon instead of pokémon
<Bagder>	with our playlist support too, it'll be a killer
<dw|gone>	yeah
<Bagder>	yeah, we have no such letter
<dw|gone>	aren't you using the built in font?
<Bagder>	there is no built-in on the recorder
<dw|gone>	ah...
<Bagder>	100% "home made" ;-)
<dw|gone>	ah, that's why it's butt ugly ;)
*	Bagder nods
<dw|gone>	5x7 in a 6x8 space?
<Bagder>	yes
<dw|gone>	Less than 7 pixels vertical will not look good, but I guess it's possible to narrow it down a bit horizontally
<Bagder>	Yes, at least some letters
<dw|gone>	The main issue is long filenames
<dw|gone>	!¤"#! archos firmware won't even show the entire filenames ,)
<dw|gone>	is it possible to have 2+ simultaneous scrollers?
<Bagder>	edx: around?
<Bagder>	dw|gone: oh sure
<dw|gone>	with the current code, thatis
<dw|gone>	how do you keep the scroller running while accessing the disk at the same time?
<Bagder>	we use several threads
<Bagder>	the scrolling is in its own thread
<dw|gone>	Do you think the archos firmware has threading?
<Bagder>	I don't think so
<Bagder>	but they could and perhaps have other limits on their threads than we do
<dw|gone>	how big is the firmware without the padding atm?
<Bagder>	lemme check
<Bagder>	hm
<Bagder>	I don't quite get the map file
<dw|gone>	mkay
<dw|gone>	well, approx 20k?
<Bagder>	when loaded, we use 4de4c ram
<dw|gone>	320k
<dw|gone>	do you know how much the original firmware uses?
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	I guess I could figure out by checking my dissassembly
<Bagder>	anyway, included in those 320K is our malloc heap etc
<Bagder>	currently we have no code that use malloc() ;-)
<Bagder>	the code is about 32700 bytes
<Bagder>	in this recorder build
<Bagder>	ouch, yellow alert!
<elinenbe>	Badger: you want to program a game -- try sokoban :)

<dw|gone>	no, rockbox :)
<Bagder>	10000

<Bagder>	edx: euuh, a little, yes ;-)
<dw|gone>	great :D
<dw|gone>	I'll test loading a huge playlist
<edx>	Bagder: what does thius line do:
<Bagder>	dw|gone: Björn has 40GB, he has no more than 5500 songs ;-)
<edx>	inURL = new URL(getCodeBase(), infile);
<dw|gone>	it constructs a url
<edx>	ok thats what i know as well.. what will the url look like?
<dw|gone>	codebase sounds JSP'ish
<dw|gone>	I dunno if it does some base64 encoding too perhaps
<edx>	ahhh .. i think i got it.
<edx>	thanks
<dw|gone>	heh.. thanks for nothing ;)
<Bagder>	edx: .. eeeeh... uuuuh. "win32 simulator break alert" :-)
<Bagder>	is there any way I can add a file to your build?
<dw|gone>	is rockbox capable of building playlists by itself yet?
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	we don't even have the write() function enabled
<dw|gone>	aah
<dw|gone>	smart
<Bagder>	yeah, its for safety
<Bagder>	we have no functions for altering disk contents yet
<dw|gone>	I like the boot speed of rockbox
*	Bagder agrees
<dw|gone>	Would be neat to know what exactly the archos firmware does that takes so much time
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	it is possible we might need to do a few of those things too in the future
<dw|gone>	any ideas of what?
<dw|gone>	it shows the disk label as a file btw
<Bagder>	I have no clue really, I just mean that we haven't quite investigated everything yet
<dw|gone>	"INSANITY.!"
<dw|gone>	true, true
<dw|gone>	it's not possible to switch it off with the power cord in
<Bagder>	no
<dw|gone>	Time to check how fast it loads a 3000 track playlist
<dw|gone>	whoa
<dw|gone>	it interprets #-lines as files
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	right
<Bagder>	I fix
<Bagder>	do they all start with # in the first column?
<dw|gone>	yeah
<dw|gone>	winamp-style
<dw|gone>	it loads the playlist FAAAAAAAST! :D
<dw|gone>	In just a couple of seconds
<Bagder>	about 1000 songs per second
<Bagder>	that is many many times faster than the built-in
<dw|gone>	hehe
<dw|gone>	yeah
<dw|gone>	1 song per second is the firmware default ;)
<dw|gone>	or perhaps 10
<dw|gone>	but that's not close to 1000 ;)
<Bagder>	it is an amazingly huge diff actually
<dw|gone>	what happens when the unit runs of battery?
<dw|gone>	with rockbox firmware, that is
<Bagder>	it dies ;-)
<Bagder>	I mean run out of battery
<Bagder>	just running on battery is no diff than with power cord
<dw|gone>	I just wonder if there is some kind of shutdown procedure required not to harm the hard disk
<Bagder>	well
<Bagder>	I think we should try to do that, yes
<Bagder>	# support added
<dw|gone>	yay ;D
<dw|gone>	is the directory browser 100%?
<dw|gone>	I mean, showing every file and such
<Bagder>	yes, there's a maximum amount of files in a single dir I believe though
<dw|gone>	I have a dir with 4 dirs and 1 pls
<dw|gone>	it didn't show the pls
<dw|gone>	m3u
<Bagder>	!
<Bagder>	what is the playlist called?
<dw|gone>	Everything.m3u
<dw|gone>	in my dir "Electronica"
<Bagder>	weird
<Bagder>	and it happens all the time?
<dw|gone>	nope only once
<dw|gone>	now it shows " - Der Sinn d" instead of Welle erdball
<Bagder>	ok
<dw|gone>	Der Sinn des Lebens is a subdir in "Welle erdball"
<Bagder>	hm
<dw|gone>	oops
<dw|gone>	I just caused a hang
<Bagder>	I wonder if there's some bug in the target dir read code
<dw|gone>	Trying to load a m3u with
<dw|gone>	\ in the filename
<dw|gone>	argh
<dw|gone>	it's a live
<Bagder>	it died while loading the playlist?
<dw|gone>	it died for a lot of seconds
<dw|gone>	then it began to live again
*	elinenbe decide to go run 100 miles while gcc builds... and then MAYBE it will be done.
<Bagder>	hehe, yeah it can take a while ;-)
<elinenbe>	not as long as anything that is qt/kde
<Bagder>	heheh
<elinenbe>	koffice took forever on a 2x1500mhz pc
<Bagder>	luckily, rockbox builds blazingly fast ;-)
<dw|gone>	:)
<elinenbe>	Badger: if I want to add " -I/usr/include " to the makefile, where would I put it?
<Bagder>	firmware/Makefile and apps/Makefile
<elinenbe>	I am compiling under cygwin and for some reason it does not find the header files.
<elinenbe>	yeah, but how do I add it into the makefile?
<Bagder>	both of them have a line like "INCLUDES=" where you can add that extra -I
<Bagder>	if this is a problem to more people, we could probably fix this better
<elinenbe>	the apps makefiles does, but the tools/makefile does not.
<elinenbe>	It is for anyone compiling under cygwin
<Bagder>	not tools, firmware
<elinenbe>	g003y had this problem
<Bagder>	hm, ok
<elinenbe>	too
<Bagder>	I think I know the fix for this problem
<Bagder>	we must add header files to our project, since we don't use newlib anymore
<elinenbe>	that could be the thing
<Bagder>	you build without newlib, right?
<elinenbe>	yeah
<elinenbe>	I did not donload it or anything.
<Bagder>	so that's it
<Bagder>	we need to supply a bunch of headers ourselves
<elinenbe>	huff.. when I do a make all
<elinenbe>	I get this garbage
<elinenbe>	Eric@VIOLET ~/rockbox-daily-20020615/tools
<elinenbe>	$ make all
<elinenbe>	make -C ../firmware TARGET=-DARCHOS_RECORDER NODEBUG=1 OBJDIR="/home/Eric/rockbo

<elinenbe>	and more and more of that...
<elinenbe>	it can not find the standard header files at all
<Bagder>	right, that's why we need to provide our own
<elinenbe>	is there any way around this for me?
<Bagder>	did you add -I/usr/include in the firmware/Makefile ?
<elinenbe>	yeah
<elinenbe>	hold on...
<elinenbe>	I added a /usr/includes by mistake
<Bagder>	ah
<elinenbe>	in tools I did a 'make clean'
<elinenbe>	make all
<elinenbe>	and then still get an error...
<elinenbe>	this is witht the most recent tarball
<elinenbe>	make[1]: sh-elf-a: Command not found

<Bagder>	!
<Bagder>	in tools?
<elinenbe>	I am just doing a make clean
<elinenbe>	make install
<elinenbe>	in the toold directory <-- that should build everything -- right?
<Bagder>	hm
<elinenbe>	but the make gives me that error.
<Bagder>	did you run the configure script in the tools directory?
<elinenbe>	yeah
<elinenbe>	I'll do that again to make sure everything is cool
<Bagder>	you should rather create a separate build directory and run the configure script there
<elinenbe>	ok
<Bagder>	mkdir ../build; cd ../build; ../tools/configure
<elinenbe>	I get the same thing
<elinenbe>	"sh-elf-a: command not found"
<Bagder>	is your PATH setup to include the dir with the sh-gcc tools?
<elinenbe>	lemme check
<elinenbe>	I followed the direction on the web page... the path should be something like "~/sh1/bin"
<elinenbe>	well, that is in the path
<Bagder>	make sure it is $HOME/ and not ~/
<Bagder>	or full path
<elinenbe>	it is $HOME
<elinenbe>	acutally the full path
<Bagder>	ok
<elinenbe>	in /sh1/bin I do not have a sh-elf-a, I have sh-elf-ar and sh-elf-as though
<Bagder>	yeah
<Bagder>	but if you check the Makefile, it uses as and ar only
<elinenbe>	ok
<Bagder>	seems to be the ar line that goes wrong
<Bagder>	it compiles all c source first, doesn't it?
<elinenbe>	the ar line in the makefile is messed up;
<elinenbe>	AR = sh-elf-a
<elinenbe>	that is what it says
<Bagder>	in the Makefile?
<elinenbe>	yeah, all the C code is great
<elinenbe>	yeah
<Bagder>	your Makefile must've been ruined somehow
<elinenbe>	in firmware/Makefile
<Bagder>	should be -ar
<elinenbe>	well, I just got it from the tarball...
<Bagder>	odd
<Bagder>	I'll check the tarball
<elinenbe>	i just checked it -- it is there
<elinenbe>	I must have messed oit up.
<Bagder>	ah, ok
<elinenbe>	thanks for the help
<Bagder>	no problems
<elinenbe>	now my enviroment is all nice :)
<elinenbe>	there we go...
<Bagder>	we'll sort out the include problem too
<elinenbe>	no problem.
<elinenbe>	it works fine with the include added to the makefile.  Is that not an ok solution?
<Bagder>	sure its ok
<Bagder>	when it makes it annoying if you wanna update often
<Bagder>	s/when/but
<elinenbe>	one last thing: how do I compile the scramble.c file?
<Bagder>	when you ran configure in that dir, the original Makefile was overwritten. Get the orginal one back and run make in there
<elinenbe>	ok
<elinenbe>	will do.
<elinenbe>	Badger: thanks so much, everything is going great

<g003y>	heya bagder
<Bagder>	hey ho
<g003y>	nice work on that include issue
<Bagder>	thanks, but we're not quite there yet ;-)
<g003y>	does the -I/to/whatever still need to be added to the makefiles?
<Bagder>	yes, I didn't really change this yet
<g003y>	ahhhh
<g003y>	ok
<Bagder>	I'm only preparing
<g003y>	well at least you figured out the prob
<g003y>	All I knew was the -I fixed it for me :D
<Bagder>	:-)
<g003y>	but I figured it was cygwin being all dumb on win32
<Bagder>	so is your "play-screen" coming anywhere?
<g003y>	well I haven't done a ton of work recently.
<g003y>	I did get setup on source forge
<g003y>	basically right now I can compile to choose between a file scroll or id3 display
<g003y>	though I'm looking into modding the settings to store it and make it user selectable
<Bagder>	user settable is nice
<g003y>	then I will add a 3rd set of logic that will attempt to pull apart directory/filename for information
<g003y>	so it looks id3 ish 
<Bagder>	remember that we can't yet store anything on disk
<g003y>	yup
<g003y>	I see the writes still return 1l
<g003y>	without doing anything :D
<Bagder>	hehe
<g003y>	so what I will do now is make the default option switchable on compile
<g003y>	then ppl will just be able to change it on the fly if they need to
<Bagder>	sounds fine
<g003y>	question for ya
<g003y>	do the playlists actually play?
<Bagder>	yes
<g003y>	dang....
<g003y>	for some reason I can't get mine going
<g003y>	it scans it and just sits there
<Bagder>	oh
<g003y>	I tried making with vi, a script and winamp
<g003y>	nothing worked for me as of a couple days ago
<Bagder>	well, to tell you the truth, I wrote the code but I have a recorder so I can't really try it on target yet ;-)
<g003y>	hahahahahahahaha
<g003y>	well I haven't really debugged into it, but the logic looks correct
<Bagder>	we might need to get someone with gdb to look at it
<g003y>	yeah I've just been "printfing" to the screen for debugging output :D
<Bagder>	yeah, and the simulators are usually pretty good too to try stuff on
<Bagder>	but not when it comes to actual mp3 playback
<g003y>	I haven't gotten mine to succesfully compile yet
<g003y>	so like the old COBOL days.... I try to get it right on the first try :D
<Bagder>	the win32 one?
<g003y>	yeah
<g003y>	but it's probably just me
<Bagder>	I wouldn't know, I've never tried ;-)
<Bagder>	I'm on the x11 one
<g003y>	the x11 seems to have more compile directions
<g003y>	I got it to compile once when I first got the firmware. 
<g003y>	though now... eh.
<g003y>	I just outright forgot how I managed it
<g003y>	I'll have to try again.
<Bagder>	it would be neat to get a cygwin version Makefile for the win32 simulator
<g003y>	oh hey.
<g003y>	there it goes with current
<g003y>	ok I was being a llame :D
<g003y>	llama that is
<g003y>	cute....
<g003y>	I need to compile the player 
<g003y>	version though
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	it should be possible
<g003y>	ok so it pulls apps logic from the apps directory right?
<Bagder>	yes
<g003y>	good
<g003y>	no screwing around then :D
<Bagder>	the apps should run pretty much unaltered in target and simulators
<g003y>	_should_ hehehehheh
<g003y>	the true beauty of C :D
<Bagder>	right, we can never be completely sure
<Bagder>	hey, I wrote my flying rockbox this afternoon
<Bagder>	all in simulator
<Bagder>	worked on first attempt on target
<g003y>	flying rockbox?
<Bagder>	you should see it ;-)
<Bagder>	kind of a screensaver, totally useless
<g003y>	you mean the logo?
<g003y>	ha
<g003y>	that will only work on the recorder right?
<Bagder>	no, the text Rockbox flying around on sine waves
<Bagder>	yes
<g003y>	hhahahahah... cool.
<Bagder>	if you get the simulator working, you'll see it ;-)
<elinenbe2>	Badger: will that be included in the tarball tonight?
<Bagder>	hm, no
<elinenbe2>	that is a shame
<Bagder>	or what did you mean?
<Bagder>	the includes right?
<elinenbe2>	no, your sine rockbox
<Bagder>	ah, that'll be included
<g003y>	yeah only the important stuff first :D
<Bagder>	hehe
<elinenbe2>	I am building a sokoban clone.
<elinenbe2>	I will get it done within a day or two.
<Bagder>	we could pretend it is useful as it tests the lcd functions properly ;-)
<elinenbe2>	yeah :)
<g003y>	hey I think it's cool so it needs to be included anyway :D
<elinenbe2>	g003y: everything is up and running great under cugwin here... Badger helped me earlier today.
<g003y>	coool
<g003y>	what was the last you needed to do?
<elinenbe2>	I had to add the included to the Makefiles.
<elinenbe2>	that was about it.
<g003y>	yeah
<g003y>	thats what I was saying yesterday
<g003y>	a -I/usr/include right?
<elinenbe2>	ya
<g003y>	good deal.  good to see you're up & running
<elinenbe2>	I am partially throguh a sokoban clone
<elinenbe2>	but, it is slow as I am running everything on the target.  I am not able to compile the simulator.
<g003y>	I just got it to compile from current myself
<elinenbe2>	how were you able to do that?
<g003y>	I sync to cvs tree
<elinenbe2>	the windows simulator?
<elinenbe2>	ah... but what did you use to compile?
<g003y>	yeah I just tried with the latest source
---	elinenbe2 is now known as elinenbe
<g003y>	nmake from a dos window
<elinenbe>	oh
<g003y>	I have vc installed with all the paths 
<PsycoXul>	so uh heh nobody's interested in writing a proper text viewer for the player's huh?
<elinenbe>	so do I, but no nmake.
<Bagder>	a text viewer should be really simple to write
<g003y>	you probably don't have all the paths registered in your environment for dos
<PsycoXul>	yeah it should be...
<PsycoXul>	i haven't had much luck with it though heh
<g003y>	you need to run the vcvars.bat which is somehere in the vc install dir
<g003y>	then run nmake in the uisimulator->win32 dir
<elinenbe>	ok
<elinenbe>	I will try that :)
<g003y>	text viewer?
<g003y>	like a text file?
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<g003y>	joc- why?
<g003y>	what you doing?
<PsycoXul>	huh? wanting to view text files?
<PsycoXul>	heh
<g003y>	yeah but just for the heck of it?
<PsycoXul>	no... for the ability to read books i've got on my archos while listening to music on it heh
<g003y>	ahhhhhhhh
<elinenbe>	I still can't run nmake.
<g003y>	thats some small text though.  you'll be scrolling from here to kingdom come
<PsycoXul>	yes
<PsycoXul>	well you only really need 1 line...
<g003y>	yeah but you'd only get some many characters wide on that display
<PsycoXul>	i figure it'd be pretty usable if it scrolled by word
<PsycoXul>	except for words >11 chars
<PsycoXul>	heh
<g003y>	heheh
<g003y>	yeah you could scroll it, but I bet after all the work it wouldn't really be usable
<g003y>	in that sense
<PsycoXul>	nah i've played with a few different methods for it
---	edx is now known as edx|sleep
<PsycoXul>	and even scrolling by char isn't unusable
<g003y>	hmmm ok
<g003y>	you're a freak :D
<PsycoXul>	heh yeah
<g003y>	though a text viewer could be used in many interesting wayts
<Bagder>	on the recorder it could be neat
<g003y>	VI for Archos :D
<PsycoXul>	but i'm just a lousy coder who can't really do it "proper" with good memory management and such like that
<g003y>	yeah the recorder has the kind of display you could pull it off with
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<PsycoXul>	well doesn't archos' firmware for the recorder already display text? i read it did...
<Bagder>	hm, perhaps it does ;-)
<Bagder>	I haven't tried it
<PsycoXul>	i figured the best player text viewer would have selectable modes
<PsycoXul>	like a 'less' style mode that gives an 11x2 window and lets you scroll around
<g003y>	yeah true
<PsycoXul>	a book mode that goes by-word scrolling
<PsycoXul>	etc 
<PsycoXul>	and a bookmark feature would also be handy
<PsycoXul>	but unfortunately my skills as a coder aren't such that i know how about going about such a thing... heh
<g003y>	well  you'd need a buffer and a file handle to get yourself started :D
<Bagder>	I think it should scroll automaticly and you'd only control the speed and pause/play
<g003y>	yup the scroll api is really nice
<PsycoXul>	my attempts at just making a simplistic by-word scrolling viewer with no fancy features have been nasty little pieces that didn't really work heh
<PsycoXul>	Bagder: thats a good idea
<PsycoXul>	save a lot of wear on the buttons heh
<Bagder>	yeah
<PsycoXul>	and fingers
<Bagder>	you'd only make it run as fast as you wanna read, and then lean back ;-)
<g003y>	or lean in :D
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	but what is memory availability like for other tasks while mp3's are playing?
<g003y>	well you're only looking at one line of text right?
<Bagder>	the mp3 buffers are never available to anyone else, so the situation is the same all the time
<g003y>	you shouldn't eat up much memory doing it.
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<Bagder>	it would need *some* to prevent it from reading from disk all the time
<PsycoXul>	but we don't wanna keep reading from disk all the time either
<g003y>	well you will need an optimal character buffer
<Bagder>	how fast can a person read? how many words a minute do an average?
<g003y>	but you're gonna have to take the hit on disk read anyway
<Bagder>	200-300?
<PsycoXul>	Bagder: i dunno, i think it varies pretty widely
<Bagder>	I guess
<Bagder>	just trying to estimate buffers... :-)
<PsycoXul>	there's also going backwards.. sometimes you just gotta go back and re-read something, or maybe you missed a word, etc
<PsycoXul>	and i dunno how to handle that sorta stuff with buffers heh
<PsycoXul>	like nicely anyways
<g003y>	you would need to define what going back means
<g003y>	1 line or word at a time?
<PsycoXul>	*shrug* i guess going backwards would probably be good going a whole line or so back per backwards press
<PsycoXul>	the way i see it maybe as far as the interface is in autoscrolling the - decreases speed and + increases it, and then play/pause does just that, and in pause mode -/+ might jump backwards/forwards a line.. or something
<Bagder>	not a bad idea
<g003y>	that could work
<Bagder>	ok, should it just output one word at a time, or try to "fill up" ?
<PsycoXul>	well i think it should try to fill at least 1 line...
<Bagder>	and 2 if there's a single word that is >11 letters?
<PsycoXul>	for book purposes i don't really see the need for filling both lines.. i played with that a bit and it didn't really improve readability
<g003y>	gotta idle
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<PsycoXul>	the 2nd line could also display something like i dunno possition or some useful thing most of the time, and a long-word wrap around like you said would probably be good 
<Bagder>	true
<PsycoXul>	bookmarking could probably be just storing an offset somewhere.. like maybe a similarly named file that you could then select to go to its stored spot in the text file or something? ...
<Bagder>	yes
<PsycoXul>	but i suppose thats gotta wait for writing heh
<Bagder>	:-)
<PsycoXul>	so should the buffer be a fixed size or maybe scale with scrollspeed or something?
<Bagder>	fixed probably easiest and probably good enough
*	Bagder has an embryo now
<PsycoXul>	wow
<Bagder>	ok, it works a little now
<Bagder>	I added it to CVS
<Bagder>	it isn't actually used yet though
<Bagder>	night

<PsycoXul>	hehe
<PsycoXul>	but hey its cool
<PsycoXul>	textshow.c
<g003y>	did you get it working?
<PsycoXul>	i haven't tried it

<Hadaka>	optionally copy in a normal firmware from archos if you don't want to use the flashrom one
<Lear>	To turn it on, I need to turn it off first... That's the problem. And nothing happens when I plug in the USB cable.
<Hadaka>	err, unplug the charger cable
<Hadaka>	and then hold the off button for a second or two
<Hadaka>	then plug in the USB cable (not the charger cable)
<Hadaka>	make sure that the USB cable is plugged in to the computer as well
<Hadaka>	and then turn it on
<Hadaka>	it should go into the USB mode
<Hadaka>	and after that you can plug in the charger cabel
<Lear>	ah, so the charger cable caused the problem. not very obvious, imho. :)
<Hadaka>	well yes
<Hadaka>	the problem being that the charger cable forces the jukebox to be on - so the hard power off doesn't work
<Hadaka>	I found out that way before I got into rockbox - but someone should write something about that on the rockbox site
<Hadaka>	like "How do I uninstall?"
<Lear>	yeah, typical FAQ stuff.

<green_>	the h/d on my jukebox 6000 is messed up
<green_>	I got a h/d disk error while using it yesterday
<green_>	Neither Windows nor Linux can mount it.
<green_>	I thought I would just try reformating it...
<green_>	..but I'm not sure how.
<elinenbe>	if you cant mount it, then it will be quite hard to format it!
<green_>	I figured it out.
<green_>	mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/sdc1
<green_>	I was missing the "-F 32" part.
<green_>	It's playing mp3 files again... phew!
<PsycoXul>	you sure the batteries weren't just low?
<elinenbe>	PaycoXul: I am almost done with sokoban for the Rockbox  (recorder only!)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	well good for you, and the recorder :p
<elinenbe>	you know that game?
<PsycoXul>	i've heard of it, i don't recall what it is though
<elinenbe>	finished my first beta
<green_>	hmmm - when I copy my files from Linux to mounted jukebox file names get truncated to 8.3.  How do you avoid this/

<elinenbe>	hey there.
<elinenbe>	I need some helps
<elinenbe>	can you send me a compiled win32 simulator?  For some reason I can not get it to compile using nmake.
<edx>	..
<edx>	why not (whats the error it gives you?)
<elinenbe>	my msvc is messed up.
<elinenbe>	it is nothing wrong with your package.
<edx>	it might not work at all hehe
<edx>	recorder or player compilation
<elinenbe>	I just made a sokoban clone for the rockbox, and it is kind of a pain loading it onto the AJBR every time.
<elinenbe>	I need both to tell you the truth
<edx>	ok wait a second
<elinenbe>	you can either email or DCC
<edx>	are you behind a firewall (or a server) or can i send files via irc?
<elinenbe>	I am behind a firewall, but it should work :()
<elinenbe>	:)

<edx>	i am sorry.. i had to kill mirc
<elinenbe>	no problem.
<edx>	do you get the request (if not i'll mail you)
<elinenbe>	yeah I got the request, but I do not think the DCC is going to work
<elinenbe>	just email them.
<elinenbe>	that would be great
<edx>	adress? :)
<elinenbe>	elinenbe@umich.edu
<edx>	there it goes... 256 kb if that is ok..
<elinenbe>	no prob.
<elinenbe>	that is great
<elinenbe>	where are you located?
<edx>	you did the sokoban :)
<elinenbe>	yeah
<edx>	Germany
<elinenbe>	it is fun
<edx>	has it been uploaded, yet?
<elinenbe>	but you know what I just made it better.  I put a dealy on key presses.  It works more nicely
<edx>	where are you located?
<elinenbe>	s/dealy/delay
<elinenbe>	Ann Arbor, MI, USA
<elinenbe>	and I can only have 4 levels. if I have more then 4 leves I get complie errors.
<edx>	i dont know sokoban... is it integratet into the source yet?
<elinenbe>	no, but you can get it at my www page.
<edx>	what's the site's address?
<ironi>	heh i just used PalmVNC
<ironi>	cool stuff =)
<elinenbe>	that is a cool program
<elinenbe>	do you have a palm phone?
<ironi>	but its sooo slow
<ironi>	no i dont
<edx>	no i dont.. i have used vnc tho
<ironi>	i have aplain old palm III
<elinenbe>	www.umich.edu/~elinenbe/ajbrec.ajz
<elinenbe>	how do I use the recorder?
<edx>	yup
<elinenbe>	the simulator I mean
<elinenbe>	how does it load the firmware?
<edx>	the firmware is compiled into it
-->	g003y (~foo@m198-187.dsl.rawbw.com) has joined #rockbox
<elinenbe>	oh
<ironi>	but even through GPRS it's way too slow
<elinenbe>	hey g003y
<edx>	i can make a compilation with your sokoba if you have source where a main function exists
<g003y>	heya
<edx>	sokoban...
<edx>	hi
<g003y>	see you got your clone working.
<g003y>	unfortunately I don't have a recorder :(
<elinenbe>	dont worry about it I will get it into the CVS
<elinenbe>	do you have CVS access?
<g003y>	only anonymous still
<g003y>	I contacted Zagor, but haven't heard back
<edx>	hmm i'll compile sokoban for the simulator.. :)
<ironi>	what's up with this clone?
<g003y>	it works :D
<elinenbe>	I just made a sokoban clone for the recorder.
<g003y>	I think...
<edx>	now i know what sokoban is.. damn that rocks
<edx>	i compiled a win32 sim with it
<edx>	interested anyone? :)
<edx>	i'll put it on my webserver and post the address in the mailing list lol
<elinenbe>	well, the sokoban is only 4 levels.  I could not make it more.
<elinenbe>	something about confliction addresses.
<edx>	hmm
<edx>	i like it very much
<edx>	it's a cool game! :) great design
<edx>	http://codeforce.d2g.com/rockbox/sokoban(win32sim).exe
<edx>	unforutnalely it doesnt seem to work at the moment
<edx>	(the address i mean)
<edx>	i have to leave now... good night
<g003y>	see ya
<--	edx has quit ("zzzZZZzzz")
<ironi>	well
<ironi>	hm
<ironi>	id love to make an arkanoid game for the player
<g003y>	oh yeah
<ironi>	but is i tpossible to control the dots?
<g003y>	the player is not as flexible as the record that way
<ironi>	or is it just possible to use symbols int he different squares
<elinenbe>	you could possibly do something like arkanoid on the player
<elinenbe>	it would be much harder though
<g003y>	yup
<ironi>	so the player display only accepts symbols?
<ironi>	i.e. i cant control every one of the ....lets say 9 dots in every char
<ironi>	separately
<g003y>	only accepts a set of valid characters as defined in the characters table
<g003y>	I believe
<g003y>	it's not bitmap based like the recorder
<g003y>	hence why all these cool little games are happening for the recorder
<elinenbe>	well, the characters are 7x9 or something likee that -- rihgt?
<g003y>	but the player mod can play mp3s at least :D
<g003y>	soemthing like that... I'd have to look at the code
<elinenbe>	that is true, but soon so will the recorder.
<g003y>	yeah anyword on that ?
<elinenbe>	nothing definitly
<g003y>	too bad archos didn't use the same chipsets.  it would probably have it already then
<Hadaka>	I think I might be making a demo on a recorder for a party that's sometime next year
<elinenbe>	go for it.  That would be great.
<elinenbe>	I think I am going to do a vector engine.
<g003y>	asteroids !
<g003y>	:D
<elinenbe>	then you would have to do sin tables and stuff like that.
<elinenbe>	maybe I won't do that...
<g003y>	heheheheheehe
<g003y>	starts to sound more like work than fun eh?

<ironi>	well i dont get very excited though :-P
<g003y>	heheh
<g003y>	w00t...  my stuff almost works :D
<g003y>	just a bit of tweaking on the string parsing and menu exit & done
<ironi>	what is it that you are doing?
<g003y>	making a user selectable mp3 play display
<g003y>	the mod right now only does id3
<g003y>	I'm adding a couple more options to this
<g003y>	one is scroll the filename ala classic firmware
<g003y>	and two is more of a path parsing to pull out relevant information
<g003y>	as well as maintain the option of id3 tag display
<ironi>	is that just for recorder?
<g003y>	no player
<g003y>	I only have a player right now
<ironi>	great
<ironi>	i have player
<g003y>	I may leave the recorder implementation up to someone else :D
<ironi>	so can you pleas emake the recation on click when scrolling a bit delayed
<g003y>	plus I will have to integrate this with playlist functionality once it's done
<ironi>	as it is now its way too fast
<ironi>	reaction
<ironi>	i'd love to try what you have done
<ironi>	to give you feedback
<g003y>	I'm sure it could be tweaked, but I don't have ssh access to the tree did
<g003y>	yeah I'll post it 
<g003y>	I just have to get the menu exit right.
<ironi>	i haven't set up a compile environment, really
<ironi>	:P
<ironi>	maybe i should
<g003y>	are you on win32?
<ironi>	yup
<g003y>	then it's as easy as Zagor's directions 
<g003y>	so long as you install cygwin
<ironi>	i do have a linux box, but it's just 486 dx4/100
<ironi>	maybe too slow
<g003y>	hahaha... wow been awhile since I've seen one of those
<ironi>	I was considering vmware
<g003y>	depends on how fast you want your mod file :D
<g003y>	anyway I'm compiling on win32/cygwin myself
<ironi>	i have it installed already
<ironi>	yeah? well isnt it so much more convenient to do it in linux?
<g003y>	it doesn't matter tome
<g003y>	cygwin gives ya a bash shell
<g003y>	from there it all feels the same
<g003y>	works the same as well
<ironi>	oh really
<g003y>	you should have the same tools at your disposal as a linux install
<ironi>	lemme see
<g003y>	yup
<ironi>	The new v0202 version now uses MinGW instead of Cygwin.
<ironi>	should i get the new one then?
<g003y>	huh?
<g003y>	v0202 of what?
<ironi>	gnush toolchain
<g003y>	I don't use gnush toolchain
<ironi>	but what then
<g003y>	that is only another way to do it, but it was more difficult to setup IMO
<ironi>	that is the instructions on the rockbox page
<ironi>	ok tlel me what to do
<ironi>	tell
<g003y>	http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/cross-gcc.html
<g003y>	install cygwin
<g003y>	then do that from the shell
<ironi>	ok brb
<g003y>	I belive edx is using the gnush
<g003y>	toolkit
<g003y>	elinenbe did it my way with success as well
<g003y>	well really Zagor's way :D
<ironi>	cygwin installer is a mess
<g003y>	it's not that bad.
<g003y>	you just have to select things ala the package menu
<ironi>	well
<ironi>	i dont knwo what i need
<ironi>	now it froze
<g003y>	ouch
<ironi>	i dont understand a thing from the packae install
<ironi>	prev curr exp
<ironi>	previous current expected?
<ironi>	but what?
<g003y>	I go with current myself
<g003y>	exp probably is experimental
<ironi>	can i actually install X here?
<ironi>	and run it under iwndows
<g003y>	IDK... I don't do X
<g003y>	I doubt it though
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	well it wa sin the options
<ironi>	it seems like one can install a complete linux system to run under windows
<g003y>	well maybe you can, but I've never tried it nor have I known anyone to do it that wayy
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	well ill skip it for now
<g003y>	good choice :D
<ironi>	oh i need ot get binutils and stuff
<g003y>	you do all that after you install cgywin to get it updated
<g003y>	you'll need to recompile gcc per his directions on the website.
<g003y>	which means you will need gcc & make and all that installed
<g003y>	you can get the tarballs for the stuff from Gnu.
<ironi>	ok cygwin instaslled
<ironi>	so now what
<ironi>	update it?
<g003y>	follow the directions on the url I posted
<ironi>	wooo
<ironi>	this is soo cool
<g003y>	yeah *nix shell on win32 :).  spooky even.
<ironi>	well it seems terribly slow though
<g003y>	what is terribly slow?
<ironi>	or this is maybe a very old version of wget
<g003y>	no probs here
<g003y>	though I just went to the gnu site, and fetched it with IE.  Saved it to the proper directory and extracted it all from the cygwin shell
<ironi>	oh really
<g003y>	yeha
<ironi>	yeah i guess that can be done hehe
<g003y>	you got unixy power and ease of IE available to you :D
<ironi>	then i can use d/l accelerator
<ironi>	way faster
<g003y>	sure whatever floats your boat
<g003y>	don't attempt to extract the tarballs with winzip though.  It's lame about it all
<g003y>	do it the way the website shows, but from the cygwin shell so you get all the tools you need.
<ironi>	i see
<ironi>	well im familiar with linux
<g003y>	alright then you should be ok
<ironi>	i dont like the look of this bash shell
<ironi>	i want directory
<g003y>	well then set it up the way you want it :D
<ironi>	heh actually never done that
<ironi>	well llook into it later
<ironi>	gdb i s jsut for remote debugging right?
<g003y>	yeah 
<g003y>	I didn't set that up
<ironi>	k
<g003y>	I do it the painful way
<ironi>	compile an dcopy to the archos?
<ironi>	and
<g003y>	yup :D
<g003y>	like the old cobol days
<ironi>	but is remote debugging possible in window stoo?
<g003y>	IDK
<g003y>	probably
<ironi>	cc not found
<g003y>	change CC=cc to CC=gcc in the makefile
<ironi>	k
<ironi>	ah
<ironi>	text editor
<ironi>	none
<g003y>	vi
<g003y>	not there?
<ironi>	no :/
<g003y>	stupid cygwin
<g003y>	you should be able to go back and install that package
<ironi>	ill just use my win text editor
<g003y>	that shoudl workd
<ironi>	yup
<ironi>	so i change it to gcc and try configure again
<g003y>	yeah
<ironi>	well i didnt have gcc either
<g003y>	oh well install it :D
<g003y>	you need a current rev to get yourself started
<ironi>	i tell you, cygwin installer suxx
<g003y>	I don't like the package selection either
<g003y>	but once it's installed it works
<ironi>	well yes
<ironi>	it owuld be coolt with an apt-like system heh
<ironi>	cyg-get gcc
<ironi>	=)
<g003y>	yes
<g003y>	that would be nice
<ironi>	wouldnt be too har dot accomplish sinc eit already is installing by downloading packages
<ironi>	prolly possible to fix in a perl script
<g003y>	does it have one once you install the main portion of cygwin?
<g003y>	I've never seen one, but it might exist :D
<ironi>	im trying aain
<ironi>	again
<g003y>	and again :D
<ironi>	it seems to be able to configure now
<ironi>	but its acting like a p133 or something
<g003y>	eww
<ironi>	http://xfree86.cygwin.com/screenshots/cygwin-xfree86-wmaker.png
<ironi>	i have to try X under cygwin
<ironi>	prolly slow
<g003y>	probably
<g003y>	but it is kind of funny
<ironi>	eyeah
<ironi>	well its kinda stupid when one looks at vmware
<ironi>	i wish there was a open source vmware clone
<ironi>	u still there g003y
<ironi>	damn
<ironi>	my cygwin dir is 300 mb now
<ironi>	that sucls

<dwihno>	Good morning Linus, welcome back to the wonderful world of ROCKBOX! :D
<Linus>	Thank you! :-)
<Bagder>	hey Linus
<Bagder>	Linus: I don't really undertand the current compile-status link breakage, can you have a look at it?
<elinenbe>	hello there
<Bagder>	morning elinenbe
<Linus>	It means that the pad section overlaps the rodata section
<Linus>	the pad section is located at an absolute address
<Bagder>	but what is the pad section for?
<Linus>	remove it
<elinenbe>	would it be possible to get CVS access?
<Linus>	the pad section is for ....padding...
<Linus>	you know the minimum size thing
<Bagder>	padding what?
<Bagder>	aaah
<Linus>	the archos firmware doesn't load very small .mod files
<elinenbe>	2:30 am -- US vs. Mexico!  I am holding out here.
<Linus>	DERBY!
<elinenbe>	hey, what is up with fillrect()  -- I tried to use this on the recorder, and it just gave me a blinking led light
<Linus>	Oh, we accidentally misspelled the lcd_blink() function.
<Linus>	Sorry, couldn't resist... :-)
*	dwihno loves the sokoban gokomuku game! :D
<Bagder>	elinenbe: mail your sf account user name to Björn to get cvs access
<Linus>	elinenbe: no text on screen?
<elinenbe>	Badger: will do.
<elinenbe>	Linus: what do you mean no text on screen?
<elinenbe>	I was just making that little sokoban game, and I attempted to use fill_rect() (something like that) and it never worked properly.
<Bagder>	elinenbe: did you try to fill a big rectangle?
<elinenbe>	not at all..
<Linus>	elinenbe: I mean "no error message?"
<elinenbe>	maybe 4x4 pixels
<Bagder>	oh
<elinenbe>	oh.  yeah there was NO error message
<Bagder>	btw, I think I've broken lcd_invertrect()
<Bagder>	whatever that function is supposed to be good for
<elinenbe>	that worked in my game.  I used it for the winning screen
<elinenbe>	it gives a nice flash effect
<Bagder>	well, were you using the cvs sources?
<elinenbe>	no -- yesterdays tarball
<Bagder>	ok
<Bagder>	I modified the behavior on saturday
<elinenbe>	Badger: what happened to Sweden in the Cup?
<Bagder>	lost against Senegal
<Bagder>	yesterday
<dwihno>	yeah :(
<dwihno>	Such a sad moment!
<Linus>	Bagder: only the recorder has reached the minimum size
<Bagder>	oh
<Bagder>	eh
<dwihno>	Andersson did a really cool circus number trying to score
<Bagder>	can we make it conditional somehow?
<Linus>	I don't think so, we may need two lds files
<Bagder>	or can we have multiple -T options perhaps?
<Linus>	multiple?
<Bagder>	I hate having two files almost identical
<Bagder>	would be better if the pad thing could be included with a second -T optin
<elinenbe>	When I tried to compile more levels into the sokoban game, it gave me an error -- is there a maximum size for variables or something like that?
<Bagder>	elinenbe: we're fixing that just noww
<elinenbe>	oh great.  that is nice.
<Linus>	elinenbe: quick fix: cvs update firmware/app.lds
<Bagder>	I made a separate lds file now
<Bagder>	elinenbe: you did notice your added files make the build go yellow? ;-)
<elinenbe>	yeah -- there was a sprintf
<elinenbe>	or something like that.  I will fix it.
<Bagder>	have Björn add you to the dev team first, then you can do it yourself with cvs

<elinenbe>	I am hgere 
<elinenbe>	I am here
<elinenbe>	I just watched USA beat Mexico 2-0!!!!
<Bagder>	elinenbe: tell Zagor your sf account name
<Zagor>	hey, elinenbe. what's your sf name?
<elinenbe>	I am most positive it is elinenbe
<Zagor>	ok
<Linus>	I have had the restart problem in my recorder
<Linus>	it turns out that the extension of the firmware has a meaning
<Bagder>	how did you solve it?
<Linus>	The only firmware file on my recorder was ajbrec.ejz
<Zagor>	elinenbe: you're added
<elinenbe>	thanks.  what is the meaning of the firmware extension?
<Linus>	i copied it to ajbrec_orig.ejz and copied the new ajbrec.ajz to the HD
<Linus>	worked OK
<Bagder>	yes, that .ejz file is mysterious
<Linus>	then i wanted to go back to the original
<Linus>	so i removed the ajbrec.ajz and copied the ajbrec_orig.ejz to ajbrec.ejz
<Linus>	no go. it booted from the ROM
<Linus>	i renamed ajbrec.ejz to ajbrec.ajz. no go
<Linus>	i had to download a new ajbrec.ajz from archos web site
<Linus>	really strange
<Bagder>	no, .ejz and .ajz are not the same kinds of files
<Bagder>	they look very different
<Zagor>	interesting
<Zagor>	i didn't know that
<Linus>	i wonder what the difference is
<Zagor>	do any of you have an .ejz file we can look at?
<Bagder>	I do
<Linus>	maybe it is descrambled?
<Bagder>	my thoughts too
<Bagder>	but there's no strings at all visisble for example
<elinenbe>	Linus: what is the status of audio on the recorder?
<Zagor>	but then why doesn't it work when you replace it?
<Bagder>	they are also differently sized
<Bagder>	-rwxr-xr-x   1 daniel   daniel     111130 Apr  8 23:48 AJBREC.ajz
<Bagder>	-rwxr-xr-x   1 daniel   daniel     136938 Apr  8 23:48 ajbrec.ejz
<Zagor>	it sure looks unscrambled
<Linus>	elinenbe: patience, Grasshopper...
<dwihno>	No status at all ? :-)
<Zagor>	at least the vector table appears intact
*	dwihno is tiny grasshopper too
<Linus>	I have I2C contact with the chip.
<elinenbe>	Grasshopper?
<Zagor>	nah, the vector table is not right
<Linus>	elinenbe: A line from a kung-fu TV series. I have forgotten its' name.
<Bagder>	Zagor: did you notice the "ARCH" text in the beginning?
<dwihno>	it's always grasshoppers in the kung-fu movies

<ironi>	i built the compiling ewnvironment using cygwin
<ironi>	it worked fine
<Bagder>	neato
<Bagder>	no include warnings?
<Bagder>	did you build with newlib or not?
<ironi>	well m y point was that cygwin just messed up and i deleted it
<ironi>	cause it sucks.
<ironi>	but it's acool idea.
<ironi>	now im going for vmware instead.
<ironi>	=)
<Bagder>	heh
<ironi>	real linux :-P
<ironi>	its kinda cool that you can assign a iso image as the cdrom for the virtual machine
<Bagder>	It Works Better (tm)
<ironi>	vmware in general impresses me a lot.
<Bagder>	its cool enough
<ironi>	something else taht is cool is PalmVNC
<ironi>	with the scaling-enabled VNC server
<ironi>	you can even get the desktop scaled to fit on the pal m screen, heh
<ironi>	people come up with the neatest things
<Bagder>	:-)
<Zagor>	hmm, should FAT shortnames be all uppercase or all lowercase?
<Bagder>	no idea
<Bagder>	I like lowercase better of course
<Zagor>	I just created "allfiles.m3u" and it became all uppercase and thus not recognized as a playlist :)
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	not case insensitive yet, huh? ;-)
<Zagor>	btw, I think we should jump through some hoops to support winamp-generated playlists. i.e. handle backslash, no preceding slash and also disk names.
<Bagder>	well
<Bagder>	the paths will be wrong anyway, won't they?
<Zagor>	why?
<Bagder>	because winamp will use the full path to the tracks
<Bagder>	and we won't use the same paths
<Bagder>	or maybe we will
<Bagder>	if we cut off the disk name
<Zagor>	yeah, but the archos is a new disk (F: for example) so the path will be ok
<Zagor>	exactly
<Bagder>	good point
<Bagder>	so yes, we should convert slashes and ignore disk names
<Bagder>	I made it ignore #-lines the other day
<Zagor>	good
<Zagor>	for some reason, winamp creates one # line for every file when creating a new list. there's no info on the line, just the filename...
<Bagder>	it supposedly can store time info etc there
<Bagder>	song lengths
<Zagor>	i'll make them lowercase
<Zagor>	umm, or maybe not. lowercasing CP437 is not so fun...

<Zagor>	usually?
<Bagder>	if the file name was an absolute path

<Bagder>	s/from/at
<Zagor>	ah, yes. missed that.
<Bagder>	we might not want that safety precautions
<Zagor>	why not?
<Bagder>	its just a matter of where to draw the line
<Bagder>	adding a preceeding slash will hardly make us find the right file anyway
<Bagder>	if the playlist uses relative paths
<Zagor>	in my test case it would work, so I'd say it has a value

<plmirc>	me too
<Bagder>	Zagor: any clues?
<Zagor>	hmmm
<Zagor>	odd
<Zagor>	the check is added
<Zagor>	where did linus go?
<Bagder>	dunno
<plmirc>	why isn't there a firmware for today about recorder version  ?
<Zagor>	*someone* broke it...
<plmirc>	the last one is for yesterday
<Bagder>	plmirc: if you check the build status at the bottom, you can see the red boxes...
<Zagor>	look further down on the page and you see that the recorder build failed in the 23:40 build
<Bagder>	Zagor: with our own "libc" headers in include/ we could move a few dir.h and file.h etc protos into the "regular" header files
<Zagor>	yup
<plmirc>	i don't see red boxes only green at the 2002-06-17 2012:20:00 linse
<plmirc>	i don't see red boxes only green at the 2002-06-17 2012:20:00 line
<Zagor>	yes but the daily build is made at 06:00
<Bagder>	04:00 GMT actually
<Zagor>	right
<plmirc>	so we have wait to 2 hours before have the daily build for recorder
<Zagor>	we have to wait 14 hours for the next build
<Zagor>	daily means "once per day". and that once is 04:00 GMT
<plmirc>	hmm ok
<plmirc>	and if one crash.. there is anything for the day
<Zagor>	but you can grab my latest at bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/recorder/ajbrec.ajz
<plmirc>	oki
<Zagor>	we make more frequent development builds, but there is little point in publishing them
<Bagder>	uff
<Bagder>	sim build died
<Zagor>	I can imagine
<plmirc>	ata -2
<plmirc>	again ...    :'(
<Zagor>	plmirc: ok
<Bagder>	ok, it seems to work now
<Bagder>	no newlib headers
<Zagor>	nice
<Bagder>	and the replacement ones are really small
<Zagor>	i'm removing newlib from the gcc instructions, then
<Bagder>	yep
<Zagor>	do you specify --without-newlib or nothing at all?
<Zagor>	when compiling gcc
<Bagder>	nothing at all
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	updated
<Bagder>	dang
<Bagder>	red builds red builds
<Bagder>	ctype
<Zagor>	booo!
<Zagor>	we need ctype for strcasecmp later anyway
<Bagder>	yeah
<Zagor>	this shuffle playback rocks!
<plmirc>	zagor : you want a retest it now ?
<plmirc>	zagor : you want I retest it now ?
<Zagor>	plmirc: no, i haven't done any changes. I need to speak to Linus first, to see what he had in the build he gave to you
<plmirc>	hm ok
<Zagor>	obviously, his code was not the same as he checked into cvs
<plmirc>	visually...

<dwihno>	Really strange.
<Zagor>	we'll be testing with some faster forms of scrolling later, that might solve it
<Bagder>	we do *two* updates when we scroll one line
<Zagor>	really?
<Zagor>	that's bad
<Bagder>	that's probably why
<Bagder>	I'll make a breakpoint and check wherefrom
<Zagor>	how do you get it to two? there's only one in scroll_thread()

<Bagder>	and an api that uses them
<dwihno>	YOU RULES! :D
<edx>	hmm the icons.. hm
<Bagder>	*cool*
<dwihno>	the button management is smoother too, I think... Am I right?
<Bagder>	dwihno: so it looks fine now when scrolling?
<alkorr>	zagor, is it you in charge of FAT ?
<Zagor>	yes
<dwihno>	Bagder: not a single flicker! :D
<dwihno>	Bagder: it's ... perfect! :D
<dwihno>	MY PRECIOUS! :D
<Zagor>	dwihno: nice
<alkorr>	there is two way to handle FAT
<alkorr>	mirroring FAT or just select the active FAT
<alkorr>	you use which one ?
*	dwihno would like a sorting which places dirs first, and then the files ;)
<elinebe|class>	did you guys ever figure out the .ejz thing?
<Bagder>	elinebe|class: nope
<alkorr>	that sorting by type could be easily done if you prefix string with one byte
<Bagder>	we use qsort, we don't have to prefix, we have structs
<Bagder>	its just that the sort function ignores type atm
<alkorr>	you mean you use a comp function pointer given to qsort ?
<Bagder>	yeps
<Bagder>	and it compares names only
<alkorr>	oh yeah
<alkorr>	more dynamic
<alkorr>	you could give to user the choice for kind of sorting :)
<Bagder>	indeed
<Zagor>	alkorr: actually, I use neither method. I use the first fat, always :)
<Zagor>	i sense a bug here :)
<alkorr>	okay, i suggest to use the active FAT on the first FAT
<alkorr>	that way, Windows knows the other FAT are not mirrored
<Zagor>	yes. still it shouldn't be much of a problem until we start writing on the disk
<alkorr>	yes i know, it is only a suggestion if you don't like to be forced to mirror the fats
<Zagor>	yes, i think it's a good suggestion
<alkorr>	there is a way to be sure that Windows and jukebox are synched
<alkorr>	to use the active fat
<alkorr>	but to tell the truth, i seldom see one fat partition use this mode.
<alkorr>	never i should say :)
<Zagor>	this is a little black magic. the specs say one thing, but what does windows actually do?
<alkorr>	i just know this option exists
<alkorr>	the only difficult part is that : can windows change the active fat without our demand ?
<alkorr>	huh, i mean : can Windows selects another active FAT without our demand
<dwihno>	alkorr: Today is a good day - the LCD glitch is removed! :D
<alkorr>	glitch ?
<dwihno>	yeah
<alkorr>	what does that mean ?
<dwihno>	like visible vsync's on the recorder
<dwihno>	a double lcd_update()
<dwihno>	so the scrolling is now flawless (up&down)
<Zagor>	dwihno: how does the side scroll look?
<dwihno>	Lemme check
<alkorr>	strange, i remember this word but i cannot find its meaning in my dictionnary :/
<alkorr>	ok, understood
<dwihno>	Zagor: lookín' good!
<alkorr>	it remembers me some old story when i had a 8086 ;)
<Bagder>	Zagor: about the 1.1 release, you could point out how cool our playlist support is already ;-)
<dwihno>	But the directory reading still appears a bit broken
<Zagor>	dwihno: that's really strange. I can't repeat that no matter what I do
<dwihno>	Hmm... Weird :/
<dwihno>	I'll let you have a look at my unit when I get to stockholm in july if the problem hasn't been solved by then ;)
<alkorr>	Zagor: my suggestion is just that at booting, if jukebox sees the FAT partition is mirroring, it sets first FAT active. 
*	Bagder sense another devcon ;-)
<dwihno>	play should also allow entering a directory/play a file
<dwihno>	YAY! DEVCON! :D
<Zagor>	Bagder: yeah, i'm raving a bit about that :)

<Zagor>	matsl: i can't think of any small isolated things. what we need right now (after 1.1 release) is improved UI.
<matsl>	OK
<Zagor>	we need to get back to viewing the id3 tag while playing, simpler volume adjustment, next/prev track etc.
<alan>	BTW, what is the status of Rockbox with Recorder ? oh yes cannot play with mpeg (missing MAS stuff)
<dwihno>	Patience, grasshopper ;)
<Zagor>	alan: yes. also it seems the rec6/10 ata problem is not completely solved yet. plmirc can't get his started.
<Zagor>	we haven't been able to reach linus since lunch, so we don't know what he did. his build is the only one that works for plmirc...
<alan>	just a question, the ATA addresses are all 3xx for Rec6/10 and 2xx for Rec20 ?
<Zagor>	no, just the CONTROL and STATUS
<alan>	okay, it is the problem
<Zagor>	??
<alan>	all the address must be 3xx or 2xx. There must be no mixing of 3xx and 2xx addresses
<Zagor>	no, but that's ok. there is only 3 or 2.
<matsl>	OK. Bye folks. See you later.

<dwihno>	Darn... My laptop purchase will leave me broke for a decade :)
<Zagor>	hehe
<dwihno>	But at least, I can play q3a :)
<dwihno>	I was thinking about making a HD swap (laptop <--> archos) :)
<Zagor>	hehe
<miah>	heh
<dwihno>	then I realized I need to get a bigger disk
<dwihno>	30 gig is not enough
<miah>	i'd much rather have 30gigs in my laptop
<dwihno>	yeah
<dwihno>	I'll get a 40 gig disk for the archos
<dwihno>	and keep all music in that
<dwihno>	then I'll keep all code and stuff in the laptop
<miah>	the only thing i hate about archos is FAT32
<miah>	and defraging over USB
<Zagor>	seriously, fat32 isn't such a bad choice for this kind of device.
<miah>	yea
<miah>	i know, but fragmentation sucks ass
<Zagor>	it's plain and simple, no fuss no special features
<Zagor>	fragmentation, with 3+ meg files?
<miah>	yep
<miah>	most of my mp3's are 6-10megs
<Zagor>	you must be doing a LOT of back-and-forth:ing...
*	dwihno agrees to Zagor 
<miah>	not really, but i havnt defrag'd in over a year, and i can tell you, songs skip now
<dwihno>	they do?
<dwihno>	what model do you have?
<miah>	6000
<dwihno>	ah, mkay
<Zagor>	weird
<miah>	but after i defrag, its all happy
<dwihno>	What amount of buffer is it in the 6000?
<miah>	2meg i think
<Zagor>	yep, same as the others
<dwihno>	defrag:ing once a year is something you do when you're at your friend's place (Zagor, hehe) with an USB2 interface ;)
<miah>	i encode all my mp3's with vbr, and alot of the songs i listen to are really long (lots of autechre, squarepusher, boards of canada, and other strangeness)
<miah>	so they're long
<miah>	and big files.. the songs i have that are 128k and small (punk stuff) playback pretty well, i dont have many problems with them
<Zagor>	miah: you could try running an analysis on it and see. i still thing it sounds odd to get fragmentation problems on this big files
<miah>	yea
<miah>	i make sure to run scandisk/norton disk doctor on it every now and then

<Bagder>	morning Linus
<Linus>	morning
<Linus>	Did you find out anything about the .ejz files yesterday?
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	but we fixed the flicker
<Linus>	oh. too many redraws?
<Bagder>	yeps
<Bagder>	one extra
<Bagder>	looks a lot better now
<Linus>	great
<dwihno>	:D
<dwihno>	Looks awesome!
<Linus>	How is sokoban?
<dwihno>	Kickass! :)
<Linus>	R00lz!
<dwihno>	The key code needs an overhaul though
<dwihno>	http://robotron.ton.tut.fi/love_on_video/koto_-_jabdah_(formel_eins).mpg
<Linus>	the key code? You mean the bouncing?
<dwihno>	bouncing?
<Linus>	or what did you mean?
<adi|home>	anyone played with the rockbox on the recorder yet?
<dwihno>	<-- did
<dwihno>	hmm
*	Bagder did too
<dwihno>	on the recorder, the button processing code is fishy, sometimes when I press once, it does the button action twice etc.
<adi|home>	did you find that the reboots seem to happen even with the dc in?
<Linus>	dwihno: that's contact bouncing
<Bagder>	reboots?
<Bagder>	I got no reboots
<adi|home>	the battery issue
<adi|home>	when i have the dc in, i still seem to get reboots
<Linus>	that sucks
<Linus>	adi|home: that _could_ be a grounding problem
<adi|home>	hmmm.. ok
<adi|home>	ideas on a solution?
<g003y>	hmph... all these recorder types.
<g003y>	:)
<Linus>	g003y: I take it you're a Player owner... :-)
<g003y>	yeah
<Linus>	me too. I have both :-)
<g003y>	though wish I had that nice bitmap screen :D
<Bagder>	g003y: you cvsup'ed recently?
<g003y>	a few hours ago
<g003y>	but my build is all jacked now
<Bagder>	oh
<Linus>	g003y: See it from the bright side, you can at least play music on your box.
<Bagder>	I had a go a the include issue yday
<g003y>	haheheehhe... just wish I could get the playlist to actually work
<g003y>	I noticed that
<Bagder>	we should dig into that problem of yours
<Bagder>	Björn played an all-disk playlist yesterday on his player fine
<g003y>	I see the includes but now time.h begs for machine/somthing.h
<Bagder>	uh
<g003y>	bagder - I think I'm still doing something wrong with the playlists
<Bagder>	how did you make your playlist?
<g003y>	tried a number of ways so far.
<g003y>	1) Vi
<g003y>	2) Winamp
<g003y>	3) Sonqiue
<g003y>	4) a script on the file system
<Bagder>	because staring only yesterday we support windows drive names and backslashes
<Bagder>	i also believe that the file names are case sensitive
<g003y>	well I tried the 17th compile from work today, but no luck
<Bagder>	ok
<g003y>	that was with a drag n drop from the drive to winamp
<g003y>	I know PsycoXul was having probs before, but he hasn't been back to confirm if it started working for him.
<Bagder>	well, I guess Zagor must show you a version working for him and then you can try that
<Bagder>	I have no player, I can't play at all ;-)
<dwihno>	Linus: contact bouncing?
<g003y>	yeah a working example would be nice.
<Bagder>	dwihno: yes, when one keypress kind of "jumps" on the contact so that it gets registered as two or more
<g003y>	thats been resolved?
<dwihno>	Bagder: I never have that problem with the archos firmware :)
<Bagder>	dwihno: no, because they "debounce"
<adi|home>	did i miss any of the core apis getting changed?
<g003y>	archos has all the docs the bastards :D
<adi|home>	namely, the rectangle functions?
<Bagder>	cheaters ;-)
<Bagder>	adi|home: they changed?
<adi|home>	i don't know
<Bagder>	hm
<adi|home>	suddenly boxes isn't working
<Bagder>	I might be responsible
<adi|home>	what was 'screensaver'
<adi|home>	it works.. but not properly
<adi|home>	what didyou change?
*	dwihno will write a polite e-mail to the archos dudes asking for docs and how they do the battery stuff
<Bagder>	did it use the XOR feature?
<adi|home>	nope
<Bagder>	ok, then I don't think its me ;-)
<Bagder>	so what doesn't work?
<adi|home>	im trying to figure out what went wrong
<adi|home>	but the'shrinking' boxes aren't displaying
<Bagder>	it works in my simulator right now
<adi|home>	really?
<Bagder>	yeps
<adi|home>	the boxes grow and shrink?
<Bagder>	yeps
<adi|home>	when did you last do a cvs update?
<Bagder>	just now
<adi|home>	ill update again
<adi|home>	i noticed it because the firmware on the website doesn't do it properly
<Bagder>	the daily one?
<adi|home>	yup
<adi|home>	btw.. how do i remove a file from cvs?
<Bagder>	odd
<adi|home>	screensaver.[ch] don't need to be there anymore
<Bagder>	rm file; cvs rm file
<Bagder>	cvs ci file
<g003y>	ahhh... current compiles for me again after a cvs update
<Bagder>	goodie
<adi|home>	god i love the world cup 
*	adi|home smiles happily
<g003y>	oh crap.... I think I spoke too soon on current.  crap :/
-->	Zagor (~bjst@mimas.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor>	hey there
<Bagder>	g003y: what fails then?
<Bagder>	hey Zagor, g003y has problems with playlists
<g003y>	well I do a clean get.
*	dwihno has no problems with rockbox
<g003y>	and it says it can't find machine/types.h
<dwihno>	other than the fishy filename thing
<g003y>	I used to do the -I/usr/include hack on the makefile
<Bagder>	uh, remove that machine/types thing
<g003y>	but now you have all the includy stuff going on
<Bagder>	I'll do it now
<g003y>	it's in time.h
<g003y>	which was added recently
<Bagder>	I know, gone now ;-)
<g003y>	cool
<g003y>	why did you add it ?
<g003y>	can recorder tell time?
<g003y>	:D
<Zagor>	yes it can
<Bagder>	we use that include file, that's why I added it
<g003y>	but the player can't right?
<Zagor>	but we haven't implemented it yet
<Zagor>	right
<g003y>	damn.... another reason to buy the recorder
*	adi|home screams
<Bagder>	I made a find and grepped out all libc headers we used and made sure I provided all them
<adi|home>	bagder
*	Bagder looks at adi|home
<adi|home>	there is NO way you have a upto date cvs
<adi|home>	boxes isn't working proper
<adi|home>	im tellign you
<g003y>	hahahahahahahahaha
*	adi|home is _not_ insane
<Bagder>	I can't but to cvs up
-->	coutta (coutta@adlax6-249.dialup.optusnet.com.au) has joined #rockbox
<g003y>	zagor: can you provide me with a smallish example working m3u you've been using? 
<Zagor>	adi|home: boxes work for me in sim at least
<g003y>	I would like to verify if I'm an idiot
<adi|home>	Zagor.. you have a recorder?
<Zagor>	yes
<adi|home>	test the latest daily build
<adi|home>	check the boxes
<Zagor>	g003y: F:\Film/Soundtrack - Cast Away (End Credits) - Silvestri.mp3
<Zagor>	 Always (Song Duet).mp3
<Zagor>	 Reunion.mp3
<adi|home>	it _doesnt'_ work
<Zagor>	oops, stripped leding slashes :)
<Zagor>	adi|home: ok, will test
<adi|home>	thank you :)
<Zagor>	g003y: what is the problem you get?
*	adi|home places the pistol to his tempel
<adi|home>	go ahead.. tell me im crazy...
<adi|home>	i dare you
<g003y>	well playlist appears to load, but then just sits at the <no artist> <no title>
*	adi|home whinces.... blinks.. turns the gun around
<adi|home>	barrel end has the bullets
<Zagor>	adi|home: i fixed dynamic IRC page yesterday, so you only have to add the log file now, not update the page
*	adi|home make a mental note
<adi|home>	sweet
<adi|home>	i have to update the log from this weekend
<Bagder> the playlist playing doesn't update the screen to anything, does it?
<Bagder> g003y: and you name your file whatever.m3u ?
<g003y> blah.m3u 
<Zagor> Bagder: no it doesn't
<Bagder> g003y: it saying <no artist> indicates that it doesn't think it is a playlist
<g003y> hmmm 
<g003y> ok
<g003y> well I must've f'd up somehow then
<Zagor> g003y: is it lowercase?
<g003y> the whole filename?
<Linus> Zagor: I forgot your NewPlayer this morning
<Bagder> the extension
<g003y> zagor: the whole filename is lowercase
<Zagor> Linus: bah! no chicken for you!!! :)
<Zagor> g003y: strange
<Linus> Zagor: Pleeeeze. Have some chicken with me....!
<g003y> zagor: I know... thats why I think it's user error still
