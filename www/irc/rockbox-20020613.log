<elinenbe>	hello there
<elinenbe>	here is a little something hard drive mp3 player related...

<Bagder>	moo
<adi|home>	AHHHH
<adi|home>	Bagder: is back!!!
*	adi|home runs away screaming
*	Bagder stands tall and watches adiamas run away
-->	Zagor (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	hey Z
<Zagor>	hey all
<Zagor>	everyone in the office is looking at the world cup... /me can't be bothered.
*	Bagder agrees
<Zagor>	Bagder: could we change the changelog file to changes-<date>.txt? apparently MSIE refuses to display .log files in the browser. at least I fail.
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	noooo :-)
<Zagor>	for some reason I can't even persuade Opera to do the right thing :(
<Bagder>	m m m mozilla
<Zagor>	yeah, but there's the rest of the world too :)
*	Bagder takes up the fight against the world
<Bagder>	ok, so exactly the same only .txt instead of .log?
<webmind>	hmm
<webmind>	isnt that the server ?
<webmind>	that gives out a wrong mime format?
<Zagor>	no, the mime type is correct. MSIE ignores mime types.
<webmind>	owh.. jolly :)
<Zagor>	Bagder: yes please
<Bagder>	coming right up
<Bagder>	there
<webmind>	u could make a symlink called: msie-change-<date>.txt
<webmind>	:)
<Zagor>	works in MSIE now
<Bagder>	i-am-a-looser-gimme-that-ie-link.txt
<Zagor>	Opera still won't display it. very strange
<webmind>	opera6?
<webmind>	opera does weird things
<Bagder>	Zagor: you should check for .log *or* .txt for now
<Zagor>	ok
<Bagder>	Zagor: the older ones are still .log
<Zagor>	opera mostly does The Right Thing, sometimes more than you want...
<webmind>	uhm yeah
<webmind>	ans sometimes completely not
<Zagor>	don't confuse "won
<Zagor>	ah, never mind
*	adi|home pokes you in the head
<adi|home>	so i never got a full answer.. what type of files are accpectable playlist?
<adi|home>	.m2u?
<adi|home>	m3u rather
<Bagder>	.m3u
<Bagder>	full path names
<adi|home>	anything else?
<Bagder>	nope
<Bagder>	lf or crlf separated
<adi|home>	right..
<adi|home>	okay...
<adi|home>	grrrrr... 2 world cup games on at once.. this is tough
-->	Linus (~linus@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor>	hey linus
<adi|home>	and both games i wanna see :(
<Linus>	moo
<adi|home>	zag.. did you see the FAQ?
<adi|home>	I put the stuf in from you /. email
<adi|home>	wanted to know if things make sense
<Zagor>	adi|home: nice. i'll take a look
<adi|home>	k
<adi|home>	let me know if there is anything we're missing
<Zagor>	yup
<adi|home>	not that i will put it in.. but go ahead and tell me ;)
<Linus>	Zagor: don't you think the FAQ should have the same blue background?
<adi|home>	id agree
<adi|home>	if you want.. i can purty it up and put it into html
<adi|home>	can keep an html and text version if you like
<Zagor>	hmm, i'd like to keep it one file
<Zagor>	i'll try to make a perl hack to format the txt file into a html page
<adi|home>	if your going to.. can you also toss in an auto index?
<Zagor>	yup
<adi|home>	all questions will be formated with Q#. on the first left col.
<Zagor>	good
<adi|home>	so just pull that and then link them to the actual question
<Zagor>	and a clear line btwn questions
<adi|home>	*nods*
<adi|home>	all answers are A#. as well
<adi|home>	and if you are really bored.. ;)
<adi|home>	you could parse for http lines and make them links ;0
<Bagder>	he should
<adi|home>	oh.. and last thing
<adi|home>	i could _really_ use central air here.. so when ever you want to come over and put it in
<adi|home>	id be ever so greatful
<Zagor>	A18 should probably not be so Gatesy. wav is uncompressed simple PCM data. you're probably thinking of WMA files?
<adi|home>	nah.. i wsa just being a dick :)
<adi|home>	i fix :)
<Zagor>	the answer is good, for WMA
<Zagor>	:)
<adi|home>	okay.. fixed
<Linus>	I had my Recorder running the gdb stub for almost a whole day yesterday, connected to the charger
<Linus>	and when i switched back to the original firmware, the battery meter was completely screwed up...
<Zagor>	ooh. for starters, or after several minutes too?
<Linus>	it is always empty when i boot it up, and then shows a normal setting
<Bagder>	weeirdo
<Linus>	and after a while it shows empty again
<Bagder>	btw, the buttons are too sensitive
<Zagor>	and stays empty?
<Linus>	Zagor: i don't know. I had it in my pocket most of the time
<Linus>	Bagder: bounces?
<adi|home>	define too sensative
<Bagder>	possibly, I just noticed that when I wanted to get into a directory
<Bagder>	I often ended up going down two levels at once
<Linus>	i have the same experience with the player
<Linus>	we need debouncing of some kind
<Bagder>	yeps
<Hadaka>	hmm, why do the buttons bounce - does the hardware actually do that?
<Zagor>	yes
<adi|home>	ahh.. that just may be our timing Bagder
<Linus>	most definitely
<Zagor>	it's a standard problem for all buttons
<Hadaka>	not on the arcade buttons I've dealt with ;)
<Bagder>	hehe
<Zagor>	that's because they added debounce, just like we need to
<Hadaka>	hardware debounce?
<Zagor>	we have to do it in software
<Hadaka>	well ok, just as long as it allows me to press a button for 1/60th of a second and still get the press in
<Zagor>	hehe. 60 Hz is quite a heavy load. I'd say 30 is more reasonable
<Zagor>	oh well, we'll just test and adjust
<Hadaka>	yeah
<adi|home>	what exactly is debounce?
<Zagor>	detection and suppression of (very) short double-presses
<adi|home>	ahh.. k
<Zagor>	it's due to there being noise in the button connection, so it sometimes electrically flip-flops several times per intended keypress
<Linus>	adi|home: we compensate for the button bouncing by reading the buttons several times
<adi|home>	*nods*
<adi|home>	grrrrr.. screen redraw on th recorder is still not right
<Zagor>	no? what happens?
<adi|home>	well.. i have a short filename
<adi|home>	and i have long filenames
<adi|home>	all is fine till i scroll and bring the short file as the last one on te screen
<adi|home>	it seems we aren't clearing the line before we draw the new text there
<adi|home>	so you have remaining garbage
<Zagor>	testing...
<adi|home>	im tracking it now
<Bagder>	try to repeat it in the simulator
<adi|home>	i am now
<adi|home>	its in the simulator that im getting it
<Bagder>	aha
<Zagor>	ok
<adi|home>	what aha?
<Bagder>	nothing, I just thought you saw in on target
<Bagder>	s/in/it
<Zagor>	I can't repeat the problem. I have a short file in the last line, no problem
<adi|home>	you need to have the short file _not_ on the screen to begin with.. hold on.. ill get a screen shot for you
<Zagor>	i didn't. it was song #15
<adi|home>	ill try a recompile
<adi|home>	maybe i have an old obj file
<Zagor>	adi|home: Q28 should read "is this legal" not "is that legal"
<adi|home>	k
<Zagor>	both "that" in Q28 should be "this"
<Zagor>	A29 will fail parsing, since it contains blank lines
<adi|home>	nope.. still getting it.. hmmm.. ill try and update again.
<adi|home>	http://orion.ramapo.edu/~rhak/misc/shot.png
<adi|home>	look at that
<Zagor>	A30 should probably say something like "The first release is called 1.0 because it has a basic working feature set, that works and has no known bugs. That is what 1.0 means."
<Zagor>	adi|home: looking. odd that I can't repeat it.
<Zagor>	ah, got it.
<Zagor>	the previous file has to scroll first, then when I scroll down I get the bug
<adi|home>	ahh okay
<adi|home>	so im not insane ;)
<Zagor>	well I wouldn't rule that out just yet...
<adi|home>	hehehe
*	Bagder hears noise from the lab
<Bagder>	there's a tv there
<Zagor>	yeah, sweden scored a goal
<Bagder>	I suspected that
<Linus>	Yieeehaaaaa!!!!!
<adi|home>	heheheh 
<adi|home>	yup
<adi|home>	just saw replay
<adi|home>	im watching the rong damn game
<Zagor>	hehe
<adi|home>	i want to watch england
<adi|home>	and i want to watch argentina lose
<Bagder>	wooo, playlist icon
*	adi|home nods happily
<adi|home>	we have it, why not use it?
<adi|home>	FAQ fixed
<Zagor>	yay, neato
<Bagder>	did anyone try to play a playlist yet?
*	adi|home is all about 1-3 line code additions ;)
<adi|home>	hehe nope...
<Zagor>	Bagder: nope :)
<adi|home>	i don't want my recorder to explode ;)
<Bagder>	haha
<adi|home>	if someone gets me a nice new compile ill test it...
<Bagder>	hehe, the recorder will happily ignore it
<adi|home>	i havent built my cross compiler yet
<adi|home>	ahh.. then nope...
<adi|home>	okay.. bleary eyes.. and im still on call for another 3 hrs.. im off to bed...
<Bagder>	night adi
<adi|home>	if you have any toher FAQ changes.. post them.. ill get them in the (my) morning
<Zagor>	looks good for now. thanks!
<Bagder>	I'm not satisfied with the scroll
<Zagor>	ok?
<Bagder>	too much blanks
<Zagor>	yes, I agree. looking at that now
<Bagder>	neato
<Zagor>	when the last char leaves the left side, the first should come in on the right. no "empty line"
<Zagor>	or do you want it even tighter?
<Bagder>	exactly
<Bagder>	I could do with just X spaces in between
<Bagder>	where X would be 2-3 
<Bagder>	I mean between the last and the first
<Zagor>	i think that might sometimes be confusing, as it wouldn't be obvious where the start is
<Zagor>	i'll do the simple fix first
<Bagder>	I think it is an improvment as it'll make more text readable at all times
<webmind>	hmmm
<webmind>	should any 60gb 2.5" hd work in a jukebox studio ?
<webmind>	or 40gb
<Zagor>	if it's 9.5mm, yes
<webmind>	nice..
<Zagor>	just check the power requirements. the toshiba 60gig draws very much power at startup
<webmind>	hm k
<webmind>	woulkd take forever to fill though i think
<Zagor>	it's not a problem, but it might make a difference in battery life
<webmind>	uhuh
<webmind>	and batterylife is already decreasing
<Bagder>	Greg Haerr seems to be "mr Microwindows"
<Zagor>	huh?
<Zagor>	oh
<Zagor>	cool
<Bagder>	yeps
<Bagder>	heh, Greg is good ;-)
<Zagor>	yeah
<Zagor>	yay, the new server hardware has arrived
<Bagder>	yay!
<Zagor>	dual Athlon MP 1600+
<Bagder>	1600MHz, aren't they called 1800 or something?
<Zagor>	ah, yes
<Zagor>	those model names are confusing :)
<Bagder>	indeed
<Zagor>	uh, my scroll fix didn't look so good on the player...
<Bagder>	ata_read_sectors() could be renamed to ata_read_sector() I guess and always read one
<Zagor>	nah we'll just fix it instead
<Bagder>	so you plan to use other than 1 too then
<Zagor>	umm, maybe not. only the fat32 driver uses ata and that always just reads 1.
<Bagder>	that's my point, if the reading works good today, then we don't need anything else but 1
<Zagor>	agreed
<Linus>	Zagor: does the ATA read sector loop need to poll the DRQ bit for each sector?
<Zagor>	ummm, don't remember
<Linus>	it doesn't today
<Zagor>	let's just skip the loop, we never read more than one anyway
<Linus>	i'm fixing the bug Greg found
<Linus>	we night gain some performance by reading several sectors at once
<Linus>	might
<Linus>	i am a moron
<Zagor>	umm, yes. but our code doesn't...
<Linus>	we do wait for DRQ
<Linus>	I'll just add the buf += 512 and it should work
<Bagder>	+= SECTOR_SIZE
<Bagder>	right?
<Linus>	yeah
<Zagor>	duh, i suck
<Bagder>	hey, Anja loved Rockbox... she could play tetris ;-)
<Zagor>	hehe
<Bagder>	although the not playing music part was a bit hard to explain ;-)
<Bagder>	"yes, this is an mp3 player but it can't play mp3"
<Zagor>	haha
<Bagder>	there are three threads right now, isn't it? with the new one being the lcd scroll?
<Zagor>	yes. i'm writing a response to his mail :)
<Bagder>	goodie

<adam>	X11 session from one Linux box to the Linux craptop
<adam>	== amusing
<adam>	prepped for the great LUG today
<adam>	:P
<Bagder>	:-)
<Bagder>	what LUG is this?
<adam>	I got a back ache when I brought my massive box last time
<adam>	heh
<adam>	a local LUG in Minneapolis
<adam>	pretty unofficial ;p
<adam>	we don't even have a website
<adam>	I think anyone who says Linux has no use on laptops is a total dimwit
<Zagor>	well whay else would you use?
<adam>	they generally don't require one use some damned 'touchpad' 90% of the time
<Zagor>	nintendo?
<adam>	I'd generally prefer a big hulking tower for Linux
<adam>	but I guess two reasons I'm REALLY liking it on this laptop
<adam>	the network segment Windows 9x basically screwed up totally with the crappy pegasus chipset USB adapter
<adam>	linux complains, but doesn't die.
<adam>	which is a huge improvement
<adam>	second off, this thing is old and slow. Linux makes it very usable. Windows does not.
<adam>	4:30 AM
<adam>	my sanity apparently exited when I first moved into x86
<adam>	moving from a 68000 to a 68040 then to an 800mhz PIII :P
<Bagder>	amiga?
<adam>	heh, nope
<adam>	amusing. running this xmms from a box on the other end of the home, displaying it an xserver on this laptop, then playing the sound via an icecasted stream.

-->	plmirc (plmirc@152.190.62.62.9massy1-1-ro-bas-1.9tel.net) has joined #Rockbox
<adam>	hi
<plmirc>	Hi at all
<plmirc>	just a very little question
<plmirc>	hmm...
<Zagor>	sure
<adam>	why not a big interesting question?
<plmirc>	why mean the message  ata: -4
<Bagder>	it means you're using old software ;-)
<Zagor>	it means the ata code bugs for recorder
<plmirc>	I'm too hurry ?
<Zagor>	try the latest daily build
<plmirc>	it is this one I tried
<Linus>	plmirc: what kind of recorder do you have?
<plmirc>	archos20020612.ajz 
<plmirc>	I have the 10 G version
<Zagor>	which recorder model do you have?
<Bagder>	*plopp*
<Linus>	i think we have found our man!
<Zagor>	interesting! we have only tested with recorder20 so far. you can help!
<plmirc>	oupsss
<Linus>	plmirc: you are our hero!
<plmirc>	ciao !!!
<Bagder>	our man
<plmirc>	really ?
<adam>	heh
<plmirc>	but why  explain me !
<Linus>	yes! we have been looking for a guy with an older recorder
<plmirc>	YEAH !!!!!!!! If I can help you the first enjoyed !!
<Linus>	plmirc: are you willing to try a test version?
<plmirc>	YEAH !!!!!!!! If I can help you, I'm the first enjoyed !!
<adam>	...
<plmirc>	Yes I want !
<Linus>	hang on...
<plmirc>	what do you want I do ?
<Linus>	can I mail it to you?
<plmirc>	y orginal firmware is the 1.24
<plmirc>	yes
<plmirc>	My mail is
<adam>	oh well.
*	adam hits the hay
<adam>	good night
<plmirc>	p_lm@hotmail.com
<Linus>	night
<--	adam has quit ("[BX] Reserve your copy of BitchX-1.0c19 for the Atari 2600 today!")
<Zagor>	night adam
<plmirc>	night
<Linus>	ok, plmirc. Hang on.
<plmirc>	I wnat to say before continue that I really love your idea to create an open firmware for the archos mp3 player/recorder
<plmirc>	And i really really want to encourage you !!
<Bagder>	:-)
<plmirc>	The World is needed men like you !!!
<Zagor>	hehe. thanks
<Linus>	thanks!
<plmirc>	excuse my english....
<Zagor>	where are you from?
<plmirc>	I'm french
<Zagor>	ok
<plmirc>	and you ? 
<Zagor>	we (the core team) are swedish
<plmirc>	Congratulation for your football demonstration !!
<Zagor>	but there are english, french and american contributors too
<Zagor>	hehe, yeah they seem to be happy about it :) I'm not much into football myself.
<Linus>	Go Sweden Go!
<plmirc>	every body is into football when it is the world cup .. isn't it ?
<Linus>	plmirc: i have mailed the test code
<Zagor>	well some of us prefer hacking :)
<plmirc>	oki
<Linus>	plmirc: but i'm not sure how it works, i accidentally included some other non-working changes...
<plmirc>	I check my mail box right now
<Linus>	(the MAS3587F code)
<plmirc>	yeah i have it
<Linus>	good luck, and be careful out there... :-)
<plmirc>	there is a big bad virus in that  ??
<Linus>	:-)
<plmirc>	no i'm kidding
<plmirc>	but why it is so small
<Linus>	surprised?
<plmirc>	the official has a double size
<Linus>	well, we are not done yet.
<plmirc>	Are you limited by the size ?
<Linus>	The limit is about 250Kb I believe
<plmirc>	I connect my archos mp3 recorder 10 G version
<Linus>	but we don't know for sure
<Linus>	*boooom*
<plmirc>	I copy your file....
*	Bagder awaits
<Linus>	(drum roll)
<plmirc>	yes i looked for this word, thx ! ;)
<plmirc>	and.......
<plmirc>	and .....
<plmirc>	and ..
<Bagder>	*silence*
<plmirc>	ok i deconnect and turn it off now
<Zagor>	the suspense is KILLING me! :-)
<Linus>	even more that the football game
<Zagor>	and to think people found the world cup match exciting
<plmirc>	hmmmm
<Linus>	than
<Linus>	don't say that
<plmirc>	rockbox vs cvs is on the screen this time during a longer time
<plmirc>	and yes i can now view all my files
<Linus>	YIPPIE!!!!
<Bagder>	*kewl*
<plmirc>	what are you changing ?
<Zagor>	YAY
<plmirc>	what did you change ?
<Linus>	The address encoding of the ATA registers is different in your version
<Bagder>	so we need to autodetect that somehow
<Linus>	I suspected this, and you made it possible to verify
<Linus>	You saved my day!
<plmirc>	I can go in and out directory whith ouot any problem !
<plmirc>	Good Job !
<Linus>	Don't try to play anything...
<Bagder>	plmirc: now press the menu key and play tetris ;-)
<plmirc>	oki
<plmirc>	it is possible ?
<Linus>	yes
<plmirc>	no i don't beleive it
<Linus>	no, playing mp3 is not possible
<plmirc>	let's try ...
<Linus>	yet
<Linus>	OK. now we need a way to autodetect this
<plmirc>	YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  OU OU OU OU OU YEAHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS WORKING I PLKAY TETRIS ON MY ARCHOS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Zagor>	plmirc: press a menu key, then you can play tetris
<plmirc>	WOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU §!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Linus>	maybe we can do the same as the master/slave detection?
*	Bagder laughs
<plmirc>	YES UES YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Zagor>	Linus: what is the difference?
<plmirc>	ou !!!
<plmirc>	whowww !! it is fast
<plmirc>	yeah !!!!!!!!!!! 
<plmirc>	it marvellous !!!
<plmirc>	I love it
<plmirc>	I made 0 line but I love it !
<Linus>	Zagor: what do you mean?
<Zagor>	what's the difference in ATA adressing?
<Linus>	The CONTROL/ALT_STATUS is at 0x61000306 in older versions, 0x61000206 in newer
<Linus>	How lame
<Zagor>	and it doesn't work to adress 306 in newer versions?
<Linus>	no.
<Zagor>	:(
<Linus>	I wonder why they have changed the address encoding in only one specific version?
<Zagor>	rec20 is obviously a major update
<Linus>	They must have screwed up
<Linus>	I mean, why have it at 206 in Player, change it to 306 in the recorder10, only to change it back in recorder20???
<Linus>	plmirc: can you be around for more tests in the future?
<Zagor>	ah, you're right
<Zagor>	I wonder what the recorder6 has
<Linus>	306 i guess
<Linus>	the difference is probably only the HD
<Zagor>	yse
<Zagor>	yes
<plmirc>	linus: yes I' ll be
<Linus>	good. we need you
<Linus>	Zagor: do you think we should autodetect or configure?
<Zagor>	i'm not sure
<Zagor>	it's a fourth target...
*	Bagder hrmpfs
<Linus>	if it's only the ATA I think we should autodetect
<Zagor>	still, if we auto-detect this why wouldn't we auto-detect the player lcd?
<plmirc>	just a little question.. again.. but songs can be played on the player version and not on the recorder version.... it will take a long time before recorder can play song too ?? Are you near of this result  with recorder version ?
<Linus>	I wonder if there are players around with 306 addressing=?
<Linus>	plmirc: it's not far away
<Zagor>	I think we'd have heard about that
<plmirc>	oki thx linus
<Zagor>	Bagder: was that hrmpf an opinion of some sort?
<Linus>	Zagor: their firmware use variables for the ATA register addresses
<Zagor>	yes of course. and for lcd function pointers
<Linus>	"of course"?
<Bagder>	Zagor: yes, I'd prefer autodetect of the ATA
<Zagor>	so should we then autodetect the lcd too?
<Bagder>	not necessarily
<Zagor>	...since?
<Linus>	no we can't autodetect the lcd
<Bagder>	the lcd differences are so huge
<Zagor>	sure we can, just like the stock firmware does
<Linus>	ah, the ond/new player lcd
<Linus>	old
<Bagder>	ah, that
<Zagor>	yes
<Linus>	i thought you meant the recorder.....
<Bagder>	me too ;-)
<Bagder>	I could very well have an player-LCD auto detect too, yes
<Linus>	that would be nice
<plmirc>	There is an  other function which can be interesting, but maybe it is too early to think about it right now, can I tell it to you now or I have to wait before speaking about new function ?
<Linus>	shoot!
<plmirc>	shoot ?
<Zagor>	go ahead and tell us
<plmirc>	ok
<plmirc>	sometimes when I'm listening a song I want to listen an other one in a other directory just after the ont which playing
<plmirc>	it is possible to select the next song which will be playing during an other song is playing ?
<plmirc>	it is like a playlist but in real time
<plmirc>	I don't know if you know what I mean ?
<plmirc>	and if you think it is really interesting ?
<Linus>	Like the queue option in the Archos firmware?
<plmirc>	yes but during a song is playing
<plmirc>	not pre-determinated like a winamp playlist song
<Linus>	Tha Archos firmware has exactly that, so I want that for Rockbox as well
<Zagor>	yeah, that will probably come sooner or later
<plmirc>	it is like when your listen a mp3 whith winamp and you select the next dropping the file in the queue
<plmirc>	well.. it was the idea of the day, if you need me just call me...
<plmirc>	going to sleep... but my computer stay online
---	plmirc is now known as plmirczzZZ
<Linus>	night
<Zagor>	Linus: is the mutex atomic?
<Linus>	probably not
<Linus>	why?
<Zagor>	i was thinking about what greg said. since we use the queue code from both threads and interrupts, shouldn't the mutex be interrupt protected?
<Linus>	the queue code doesn't use the mutex
<Zagor>	ah, ok then
<Linus>	it disables the irq
<Zagor>	good

<plmirc>	I just wake up and I made a dream.. I play Tetris on my archos with an other opposant through usb cable, it will be possible ?
<Zagor>	no, usb is out of our control
<plmirc>	snif :'(
<Zagor>	it is only for harddisk access
<plmirc>	there is the digital IN/out port !!!!
<Zagor>	yes, it's a little boring
<Zagor>	yes but that's only for sound data. we can't access it directly either
<plmirc>	i know it is possible to have information from ear port
<Zagor>	no, only to the port. not from.
<plmirc>	it is the way of remote control
<Zagor>	yes, but it's only one-way
<plmirc>	hummm ok.... hmmm . there 's any port again...
<plmirc>	:'( one-way, no way...
<plmirc>	yeah !!! I found !!!!!!!!
<plmirc>	why not use the line-in port for the one-way information and the ear port for the other-way information ???
<Zagor>	the ear port is the only port we can control. line is directly connected to the sound chip
<plmirc>	dawn !!!
<plmirc>	shit !!
<Zagor>	now now, no foul languange necessary

<elinenbe>	I was jsut reading thorough the logs.my recorder firmware is 1.17ia.  I still get the ATA error with the dail builds
<Bagder>	elinenbe: what recorder type?
<Zagor>	elinenbe: the new ata code isn't in the daily yet. it was just a test.
<elinenbe>	it ia a recorder 6GB
<Bagder>	elinenbe: yes, that once will need a fix
<Bagder>	that one
<elinenbe>	have you figured out the problem with this version?
<Zagor>	ok, so at least we know 6 and 10 are the same
<Bagder>	yes
<elinenbe>	send me the firmware and I will try it out.
<Bagder>	Zagor: do you have any good idea on how to autodetect?
<Zagor>	we could probably do something in the line of our master/slave detect. test the two addresses and see who responds correctly
<Zagor>	elinenbe: are you prepared to test?
<elinenbe>	I am always prepared.
<elinenbe>	I am using chatzilla here though, so I have no DCC transfers.
<Zagor>	no problem, i'm putting it on the web server
<elinenbe>	you have to support the OSS movement.
<Zagor>	the force is strong with you... :)
<elinenbe>	I see the change logs have added a CR or a LF to the end.  This makes windows users happy.
<Bagder>	actually, the extension was changed and that's the only diff ;-)
<Zagor>	it's just silly windows browsers that care about filenames instead of mime types
<elinenbe>	true.  It was changed from .log to .txt
<elinenbe>	that is some stupid shit
<Zagor>	that is msie for you...
<elinenbe>	just tell me when it [the recorder firmware] is up on the web page.  I will go to town with it.
<Bagder>	it doesn't play any music yet though ;-)
<elinenbe>	understandable... who needs to play mp3s anyway
<Zagor>	tetris works, that's all you need :)
<elinenbe>	true.

<Zagor>	go go go
<Zagor>	noooo, won't work. stop
<Zagor>	now
<Zagor>	my fingers are quicker than my brain :)
<elinenbe>	so, should I try it?
<Zagor>	yes
<Zagor>	i'll try it on my rec20 too
<Zagor>	works for me. how about you?

<elinenbe>	Paraguay is now up 3-1 on Slovenia -- 3 goals in the 2nd half
<elinenbe>	"ata: -4"
<elinenbe>	:(
<Bagder>	ough
<Zagor>	hmm, ok new version. try again.
<Bagder>	was that an autodetect attempt?
<Zagor>	yes
<Zagor>	worked for me, but I set one bit wrong
<elinenbe>	on the player why dont you use the up down buttons to scroll through the directory?  and the left right to go into/ out of the directory.
<elinenbe>	it seems more logical
<Zagor>	because it doesn't have up and down buttons.
<Zagor>	people have used left/right (which are actually called -/+) for ages, they will scream bloody murder if we change that
<Zagor>	look at the comparison and you'll see the player doesn't use the same cursor navigation concept as the recorder
<elinenbe>	true.  I forgot.  I used to have a player, but I got one of the first recorders.
<Zagor>	Linus|meeting: what were the addresses? you said 0x06100306 and 0x06100206 but the "old" code uses 0x06200206
<Zagor>	this last version gives me an ata: -4 too

<edx>	hi
<Bagder>	hey
<elinenbe>	hey there.
<edx>	*fixing win32 code finally now..*
<Bagder>	coolio
*	elinenbe starts yelling "E-D-X" at the top of his lungs and wakes the neightbors!
<edx>	lol
<elinenbe>	after scrolling and playlist are added, just the playmodes need to be added and we almost have equal functionality to the original player!
<elinenbe>	that is quite impressive.
<Zagor>	yeah, it's gone quickly
<edx>	heh has Archos ever contacted you Bjorn?
<Zagor>	not about rockbox, no
<edx>	hehe
<edx>	whether they even know..?
<Zagor>	they wanted my help developing the multimedia jukebox last summer, though...
<edx>	cool
<elinenbe>	are you serious?
<elinenbe>	did you help?
<edx>	this multimedia thing rocks.
<edx>	how come they chose you? :)
<elinenbe>	that multimedia thing has been delayed more than 6 months!
<Zagor>	yup. but they bailed out when they saw my hourly rates :)
<edx>	lol
<Zagor>	they had seen my "dissecting the archos" page and the linux driver
<edx>	ah
<elinenbe>	well, at least they know where to look
<elinenbe>	myabe they should have highered someone who request higher rates.
<Zagor>	hehe
<elinenbe>	there stuff is "quite" buggy
<elinenbe>	I dont have a player so I have yet to test the recent functionality, but have you heard of any crashes -- (as inthe archos crashes where you have no clue what is going on)
<Zagor>	no, we've had very little problems
<elinenbe>	that is quite excellent.
<Bagder>	I suspect that it isn't being used very heavily yet
<Zagor>	yes, that's nice. we found and nailed a rather nasty bug just before release, so we've had a bit of luck too
<Bagder>	when the playlists come, I think that'll improve
<Zagor>	yup
<elinenbe>	I was wondering if you would be able to have a "high-activity" buffering mode and a "low-activity" buffer mode?
<Zagor>	are they playlists ready for random, bagder?
<Zagor>	elinenbe: why?
<Bagder>	Zagor: yes they are prepared, the code is all there
<elinenbe>	by that I mean you can have redundant disk reads? like if you are running with the player.
<Zagor>	we'll have to do lots of testing first, to see how (and even if) we can improve skipping
<elinenbe>	then it could read the disk more often... and verify the data or try and reread the data, or just struggle with whatever data it is reading
<Zagor>	Bagder: can we randomise the playlist while playing it?
<elinenbe>	what will happen on the player if I shake the hell out of it while it is playing... for a few minutes?
<Zagor>	(sorry haven't read the code very thoroughly)
<Bagder>	Zagor: sure
<Zagor>	elinenbe: i don't know :)
<Zagor>	Bagder: so if I add a "randomize" entry to the menu, we're pretty much set?
<Bagder>	Zagor: pretty much, we might want one option to toggle "shuffle" and perhaps another one for reshuffle

<Zagor>	Bagder: umm, how do we turn off random?
---	plmirc is now known as plmirc|zzZZ
<Bagder>	uh
<Bagder>	;-)
<Bagder>	we'd need to reload the playlist
<Bagder>	to get the correct order back
<Zagor>	well, we don't have to support "un-randomizing" right now
<edx>	hmm Bagder...
<Bagder>	yes?
<edx>	Bagder: lcd_init..what's that
<edx>	I cant use that :P
<Zagor>	starting the scroll thread
<edx>	ah ok
<edx>	then i can..
<edx>	sorry ;)
<Zagor>	hehe
<elinenbe>	I think in time a "The" filter should be added in...
<edx>	what are the params of create_thread.... ?
<elinenbe>	where files that start with "The" the "The" is ignored...
<Bagder>	create_thread(void* fp, void* sp, int stk_size)
<Bagder>	function pointer, stack pointer, stack size
<edx>	hmm ok
<Zagor>	elinenbe: hehe
<Bagder>	we need a generic "filter" to present song names shorter
<Bagder>	I might have a go at someting like that soonish
<Zagor>	it's an 1.2 feature anyway
<Bagder>	yeah
<Bagder>	but even 1.2 features need to be written ;-)
<Zagor>	hehe, yup
<edx>	Bagder.. what do you do with the stack pointer?
<Bagder>	nothing
<edx>	good
<edx>	me neither lol
<Bagder>	;-)
<Bagder>	pthreads usually have 2MB stack anyway
<edx>	i use the stk_size variable though...
<Bagder>	don't
<edx>	what is init_threads supposed to do btw.. (why not?)
<Bagder>	you're likely to use more stack than the target
<edx>	ok
<Bagder>	so the stack size will be tuned for target performance and may not be good enogh for hsot
<edx>	hmmm with the linux simulator.. dont you get "mpeg_play undefined" or something like that?
<Bagder>	no
<edx>	ah
<edx>	ok i see
<Bagder>	I have a stub for it
<edx>	you defined it
<edx>	(ill just copy..)
<Bagder>	there's a init_threads() too in the x11 sim
<edx>	and then.. whats yield?
<Bagder>	yield is: "now, someone else might want to run a while"
<Bagder>	we have cooperative multitasking
<edx>	aha
<Bagder>	each thread must themselves let go
<edx>	uhmm... where is it defined (and do i need a stub for it?)
<Bagder>	you implement the thread layer
<Bagder>	you need to provide yield
<edx>	aha
<edx>	i still dont get what its supposed to do
<Bagder>	edx: you should make sure that only one thread at a time is running
<edx>	and where is it defined for the target?
<Bagder>	and when the thread calls yield(), another thread may start executing
<edx>	ok.. start or continue?
<Bagder>	yield() is in kernel.c
<edx>	k
<Bagder>	continue
<Bagder>	create_thread() starts threads
<Bagder>	all threads must call yield()
<edx>	ok no problem then.
<edx>	is there a stop_thread or somehting alike?
<Bagder>	only when a thread calls yield will any other thread get to run
<Linus|meeting>	No
---	Linus|meeting is now known as Linus
<Bagder>	no stopping of threads, no
<edx>	and why not? :)
<Bagder>	we don't need it
<edx>	(the scroll thread is always running..?.. yes)
<Bagder>	if the need ever comes up, we'll add it
<Bagder>	yes

*	Bagder switches to his rockboxcvs box
<Bagder>	now come to papa

<Zagor>	Linus: bah, mine is a lot smaller
<Zagor>	but it still doesn't work.
<Bagder>	haha
<Linus>	Mine works
<Zagor>	for rec6?
<Linus>	yes
<Linus>	oh, sorry, i havent tried that
<Zagor>	give it to elinenbe
<Linus>	does he have a 0x306 box?
<Zagor>	rec6, yes
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	elinenbe: here?
<Zagor>	why would the data stay on the bus when we have read lots of instructions inbetween the accesses?
<Linus>	so you know that rec6 has 0x306 address encoding?
<elinenbe>	I am here.
<Zagor>	at gives ata: -4 anyway, which indicates it
<elinenbe>	but leaving for class soon
<elinenbe>	I have a rec6
<Linus>	because we don't execute code behind the ATA buffers
<Bagder>	elinenbe, pick a recorder version here http://storebror.haxx.se/archos/
<elinenbe>	Badger: that version works.
<Linus>	Zagor: it is not about data staying on the CPU data bus, it's about data staying on the ATA bus
<Bagder>	*ding*
<Bagder>	neato
<elinenbe>	I can scroll through the songs!
<elinenbe>	great!
<Zagor>	nicers
<elinenbe>	that is nice.
<Bagder>	coolers boys
<Zagor>	i still think we should combine the master/slave and version check :)
<Zagor>	linus version is bloooooated ;)
<Bagder>	haha
<Linus>	What is bloated about it?
<Bagder>	he still has 1 - 0 for making it work ;-)
<Zagor>	just kidding, i did it like this:
<Zagor>	    /* check for master/slave on both control addresses */
<Zagor>	    for ( control_addr = (void*)ATA_CONTROL_ADDR1;
<Zagor>	          control_addr !=(void*)ATA_CONTROL_ADDR2;
<Zagor>	          control_addr = (void*)ATA_CONTROL_ADDR2 ) {
<Zagor>	that brings down the change to about 10 lines
<elinenbe>	nice.  can you get the scrolling faster?  :)
<Zagor>	elinenbe: go into the menu and set the speed yourself
<elinenbe>	well, laters.  congradualtion on the fine effort.
<edx>	what does create_thread return on failure / success?
<Bagder>	I want page down/up in three browser
<elinenbe>	very nicely done.
<Bagder>	tree
<Zagor>	Bagder: yes, but that requires multiple keys which we don't support yet
<elinenbe>	how about how soon it scrolls?  -- like as soon as you put the curson on the filename.
<Linus>	gotta go. bye!
<Bagder>	ah

<Zagor>	yes
<edx>	when?
<Zagor>	i'm working on a better scroll, though
<edx>	... i would like to see scrolling... it doesnt scroll :)
<Bagder>	it should scroll
<Zagor>	short names don't scroll. find a long filename
<edx>	folder name.. ?
<Zagor>	file or folder
<edx>	(long folder name wont scroll.. :()
<Zagor>	then it's a bug

<edx>	ok that sucks... the thread suspends itself :/
<Bagder>	hehe
<edx>	not funny :P
<jedix>	whats new?
<Zagor>	we got the ata code working on all recorders now
<edx>	it wont scroll!
<edx>	scroll_count stays 0.. also for folders :/
<Bagder>	it scrolls on target

<edx>	thanks
<edx>	ok scrolling works in the menu!
<edx>	not whilke browsing though
<Zagor>	weird
<Zagor>	add a debugf() in scroll_thread to see that it's running properly

<Zagor>	haha
<edx>	scroll_count
<edx>	that is 0...
<edx>	hmm
<edx>	lcd_puts_scroll sets it to 1...
<edx>	now that's weird.
<edx>	uhm
<edx>	its 0 again... for some reason.. uhm.. well ill debug a little
<edx>	why is lcd_stop_scroll called directly before putsscroll?
<edx>	that's not wonder at all ... stop_scroll sets it to 0 again!
<Zagor>	because stop_scroll restores the line. the next putsscroll starts scrolling on another line
<edx>	hmmhm
<edx>	but its called over and over again
<edx>	(tree.c ln 366)

<edx>	hah! setting scroll speed to 1.. then it works LOL
<edx>	scroll_speed/2 .. that does not work according to c... for scroll_speed = 1 (1/2 = 0)
<Zagor>	yes, don't use scroll_speed=1
<edx>	thats the only number it works for lol
<Zagor>	eh? make it better :)
<edx>	it's set to 0 (by scroll_stop) before the scroll function is called - how can this work whereever else..?
<Zagor>	no, scroll_count is set to 0. not speed.
<edx>	ok
<edx>	whatever.
<edx>	still... why?
<Zagor>	well there's a difference :)
<Zagor>	because by setting it to 0 the scroll stops
<edx>	great.
<edx>	then it stopsstopsstops ...
<edx>	line 366 is called more than 10 times a sec...
<edx>	is that correct?
<Zagor>	366 is "return false;"
<edx>	*crying...*
<edx>	        lcd_stop_scroll();
<edx>	that's what it is
<Zagor>	no, i don't get that called other than when the screen is scrolled or the cursor is moved
<Zagor>	where is it called from?
<edx>	ok.. now it is return false; (done another update)
<Zagor>	returns?
<edx>	still.. it wont scroll...
<Zagor>	it's void. what are you doing?
<edx>	now its line 359 i am talking about

<gregh>	hello
<gregh>	is this the rockbox developer irc channel?
<ironi>	yepp
<ironi>	that's it?
<ironi>	all you had to ask?
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	would you believe I've been hacking code for 20 years
<gregh>	and never used irc?
<gregh>	a few folks suggested I get on this channel
<gregh>	I was thinking of jumping in and hacking the windows
<gregh>	simulator version a bit... I'm stuck using windows
<gregh>	for now and its hard to dual boot...
<ironi>	heh =)
<ironi>	i see
<ironi>	well welcome to irc
<ironi>	you have missed out on something for the last...well not 20 but maybe 10 years
<adi|work>	hey gregh... glad you came over :)
<adi|work>	you just missed Bagder and Linus
<gregh>	who is adi|work?  Is that edx?
<adi|work>	they went to sleep a bit ago..
<adi|work>	adi|work: adiamas
<gregh>	oh shoot.
<adi|work>	adi|home: adiamas
<adi|work>	:)
<adi|work>	they are in sweden...
<ironi>	hm
<ironi>	and i am just a wannabe that has been around since day 1 of development
<gregh>	I'm thinking it would be fun to hack some code for the player
<ironi>	the only i have contributed with is the name "rockbox" and a bit of the website design
<gregh>	but I'm lazy and don't have time to cross compile so I've
<gregh>	got to get the windows simulator working great first...
<gregh>	ironi - well you did a good job on the name!
<ironi>	gregh: I'm kind of prud actually
<ironi>	hehe
<ironi>	I would hack code if I knew more
<ironi>	But I'll give it some more time
<gregh>	does everyone here use the x11 version, or instead
<gregh>	the actual target version?
<ironi>	heh gregh you dont need to press enter like that
<ironi>	=)
<PsycoXul>	haha
<gregh>	oh, were your screens scrolling?  I double clicked on a few
<gregh>	peoples names...  I don't quite know what I'm doing on IRC!!
<PsycoXul>	just type what you wanna say
<PsycoXul>	nothing special
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	it was interesting to see where everybody's IP address was
<gregh>	ok, I think I've got it back under control now...
<gregh>	so - what feature should I hack on first?
<PsycoXul>	you can put more on 1 line, rather than hitting enter between pieces ... 
<ironi>	gregh: what client do you use?
<gregh>	I just pulled down mIRC.  What do you recommend?  I am hitting enter a bit frequently, I see
<ironi>	gregh: well mirc is good for beginners
<ironi>	stick to that for a while
<ironi>	i personally use xircon, another windows client
<gregh>	hehe
*	PsycoXul recomends *NIX clients :p
<ironi>	which i find better , but i guess that is just what im used to
<ironi>	PsycoXul: u think? for a newbie?
<PsycoXul>	well if he's on windows he can't very well use them so i guess he's better off sticking with mirc
<ironi>	gregh: well a few hints: you doint need to type the entire nick of someone you address, jsut type first letter then tab
<PsycoXul>	:p
<ironi>	or a few letters then :
<gregh>	mIRC requires payment after 30 days I think
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	sure it does 
<PsycoXul>	:p
<gregh>	I have to use windows for my damn email for the time being
<ironi>	 /j to join /msg to private message /dns to see ip of a user, /notice to notice a user, /server to change server
<ironi>	the basic irc commands
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	i cant beilieve there are actually ppl on this planet that have never used irc...today...2003 =)
<ironi>	no offence, gregh
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	ironi: you get out much?
<gregh>	well, I spend too much time in the VI editor.
<PsycoXul>	lots of people haven't used irc :p
<ironi>	PsycoXul: wel i mean like programmers, computer-freaks etc
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	I readily admitted my IRC failings so that you wouldn't think I'm completely out of it...
<ironi>	PsycoXul: yah i get out much but irc is a part of my life
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<gregh>	what happens if you're gone for a while and someone sends a message, etc?
<PsycoXul>	irc's funny like that
<ironi>	It sounds kinda geeky to say u have friends on irc, that you consider your friends.
<PsycoXul>	well if you're not connected then you're not on the network to get it
<PsycoXul>	it'll tell them you're not there
<ironi>	gregh: you can set your self away like /away reason bla bla
<PsycoXul>	if you are connected it'll scroll in your client, and depending on settings your client may log it for you
<gregh>	I can see that IRC is much more interactive than email, and you can get a better feel for the type of person you
<gregh>	re communicating with...
<ironi>	gregh: of course
<PsycoXul>	or it'll just be like in the scrollback
<ironi>	hell, I met my girlfriend on irc
<ironi>	hahaha
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	are the communications in IRC logged ?
<ironi>	gregh: you can log it, yes
<gregh>	(I wonder if I'll meet my future ex-girlfriend on IRC?)
<gregh>	I mean is there a master log for review?
<ironi>	gregh: optimistic, aye?
<PsycoXul>	servers don't log
<ironi>	gregh: I don't think so
<PsycoXul>	generaly
<ironi>	Never heard of it anyway
<PsycoXul>	other people connected and in the channel can log the chan though
<ironi>	gregh: well you wont find any girls (hardly) on this network =)(
<PsycoXul>	ironi: where will you find them?
<gregh>	ironi: yeah, I bet not ;-(
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	I meet girls with my rockbox, though =)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<ironi>	PsycoXul: i just meant there are other networks with channels that are more for "ordinary" ppl
<ironi>	chat channels
<ironi>	gregh: hehehe
<PsycoXul>	ah
<PsycoXul>	yeah but ordinary people suck :/
<ironi>	well
<ironi>	gregh: another good irc network (i think) is efnet, weher eoyu can find a lot of good channels
<PsycoXul>	yeah efnet's huge
<PsycoXul>	lots of people, lots of chans
<PsycoXul>	i dunno that i'd call it a good network though
<PsycoXul>	:p
<ironi>	PsycoXul: well its a good balance between good topics and off-topic talk
<ironi>	if you know what i mean
<PsycoXul>	well that all depends on the chan
<ironi>	comparing to nets like dalnet =)
<ironi>	PsycoXul: of course
<--	gregh has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))

<gregh>	yepp
*	ironi has no clue
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<ironi>	gregh you can use /me to talk about yourself in third person
<gregh>	do you know why I was just disconnected with no warning?
<ironi>	so are you close?
<PsycoXul>	connection reset by peer
<PsycoXul>	well i guess not so close if he's on a beach
<PsycoXul>	i'm rather inland
<ironi>	newport beach and colton
<gregh>	where is PsycoXul? I missed the last 3 minutes
<ironi>	ok
<gregh>	where the heck is colton?
<PsycoXul>	near rialto
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	ok, where is rialto...
<ironi>	hahaha
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	I'm from salt lake city, actually
<PsycoXul>	san bernardino county
<gregh>	but hangin here in newport
<ironi>	well im in sweden
<gregh>	what time is it, ironi
<PsycoXul>	pretty close to riverside i think
<ironi>	i was in saint louis, MO for 5 months last year though
<gregh>	oh, then you are near chino?
<ironi>	2:48 am
<PsycoXul>	i'm not sure where chino is 
<ironi>	you guys haha
<PsycoXul>	heh
<ironi>	sometimes i forget how damn big usa is
<gregh>	he he, CA's too big a place
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	it sure is
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	yeah california could be 2 states
<PsycoXul>	and still be pretty big ones
<PsycoXul>	:p
<gregh>	probably will be someday
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<ironi>	but you both have *,dsl.lsan03.pacbell.net
<PsycoXul>	yeah 
<PsycoXul>	pacbell's funky
<ironi>	sounds to me like you should be close :-P
<PsycoXul>	i'd think so too
<ironi>	i has swbell when i was in stl
<ironi>	had
<gregh>	ironi: i typed '/dns ironi' and nothing happened...
<ironi>	nothing?
<ironi>	strange
<ironi>	try /whois ironi
<PsycoXul>	since i've seen .dsl.XXXX.pacbell.net different one's for LA and san diego i figured lsan was san bernardino..
<ironi>	not same thing
<gregh>	where's it supposed to put the info, on the line above?
<ironi>	on the line you type
<ironi>	oh oh
<ironi>	default mirc
<ironi>	in the status window
<ironi>	is where it gets put
<ironi>	damn default mirc is not all that funny
<gregh>	oh, yes, there it is, hidden behind my window
<PsycoXul>	and btw for unix/linux irc client i recomend irssi
<ironi>	I would recommend xircon if you want winsdows gui client
<ironi>	irssi rocks
<ironi>	but i like windows
<ironi>	to put 4 channels in a tile
<ironi>	so i can see all at once on my 19"
<PsycoXul>	heh
<ironi>	thats heaven for me :-P
<ironi>	actually 6 right now
<gregh>	ah yes, that sounds like a good idea for a long time IRC person
<PsycoXul>	you can have windows in irssi arranged how you like them
<ironi>	PsycoXul: nut in 2x2
<PsycoXul>	really?
<ironi>	just above each other
<PsycoXul>	i use fullsize windows
<ironi>	as far as i know
<ironi>	you talking console irssi?
<PsycoXul>	15 of them right now
<gregh>	any idea why I was disconnected without notice?
<PsycoXul>	though only 14 in use :p
<ironi>	ok wlel then you have to press buttons to change chans
<PsycoXul>	alt and a number
<PsycoXul>	big deal :p
<PsycoXul>	like my hands aren't already pressing buttons to be and chat on irc :p
<ironi>	gregh: connection reset by peer
<PsycoXul>	its more convenient than having to move a hand over to the mouse
<gregh>	you're talking a human or machine?  You mean TCPIP reset by peer
<PsycoXul>	and i don't have the precious screen real estate to have them all visible at once
<PsycoXul>	...especialy having 14 windows 
<PsycoXul>	being on 4 different networks
<gregh>	control-shift-f6 will change between mdi windows in windows
<ironi>	gregh: if it happens sometimes, its just like that, it happens
<PsycoXul>	10+ different channels
<ironi>	im on 2 networks
<ironi>	gregh: i would really recoomend xircon to you
<ironi>	its really nice
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<ironi>	for windows
<gregh>	I'll pull it down
<ironi>	you do need kano too
<PsycoXul>	xircon's the least-shitty windows irc client i've found
<ironi>	xircon raw is crap
<PsycoXul>	:p
<ironi>	PsycoXul: with kano its really extensive
<ironi>	the nick completion is unbeatable
<PsycoXul>	yeah i've seen kano
<PsycoXul>	i like irssi's nick completion
<gregh>	is kano an addon
<PsycoXul>	yeah its a script
<ironi>	http://www.xircon.com/pub/xircon/XiRC10B4.EXE
<ironi>	install that first
<PsycoXul>	i'm not a big fan of tcl personally
<ironi>	dont bother to run it befor eyou install....
<ironi>	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kanotcl/k15beta8.exe
<ironi>	that
<PsycoXul>	i'm not really fond of perl either, but i respect it and its a lot better than tcl :p 
<PsycoXul>	heh
<ironi>	when running the kano installer make sure you select the "first time install"
<ironi>	irssi is tcl or?
<PsycoXul>	irssi uses perl for its scripting
<PsycoXul>	xircon uses tcl
<ironi>	http://telia.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/kanotcl/k15beta8.exe
<ironi>	try that link for kano
<ironi>	the first one maybe didnt work
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	www.xircon.com/pub/xircon/XiRC10B4.EXE
<gregh>	I had to repeat that since I finally got logging turned on
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	ok
<ironi>	you can click that link to open broswer
<ironi>	at least in xircon
<gregh>	and I never know when I'll get a disconnected
<ironi>	gregh: heh that doesnt happen so often, and with xircon + kano the windows wont empty when you reconnect
<gregh>	oh..
<gregh>	ok, got em both downloaded
<ironi>	even if oyu get kicked and rejoin
<ironi>	so install xircon first
<ironi>	then after that install kano and make sure you select the update settings box
<gregh>	shall I install it right now while I'm talkin with you guys?
<ironi>	makes some things easier
<ironi>	sure why not
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	here goes
<gregh>	heh
<PsycoXul>	imma go watch the conformavision
<PsycoXul>	bbl :p
<gregh>	xIRC installed
<ironi>	k
<gregh>	except no desktop icon, hm
<ironi>	its in the start menu
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	well dont run it
<ironi>	install kano first
<gregh>	installing kano now...
<ironi>	k
<ironi>	now xirocn is a bit different but a lot easier to understand i think
<ironi>	especiallt he cinenct dialog
<gregh>	did you say  I should check the "update settings" box?
<ironi>	yep
<ironi>	definitely
<ironi>	did you?
<gregh>	and all the other boxes?
<ironi>	yah i think so
<ironi>	dont rememberthe others
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	ok kano installed
<gregh>	now what
<ironi>	so now start xircon
<gregh>	should i log in and keep connected here also?
<gregh>	can you run two clients?
<ironi>	yeah if its possible
<ironi>	well yes
<gregh>	ok, here goes...!
<ironi>	but sometimes a server doenst accept two conenctions
<ironi>	from same if
<ironi>	but if you conenct to irc.openprojects.org you wont always end up on the same
<ironi>	it redirects
<gregh>	i'm running it now, does it always take a bit after logging into the server to ask for the channel connection?
<ironi>	oh you mean the pop-up window?
<gregh>	yes, it's got a black (single) window
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	you can use /j rockbox
<ironi>	 /j is short for join
<ironi>	not working?

<ironi>	hehe
<ironi>	there u go
<new_gregh>	hehe
<ironi>	ok so there are a few things you should configure
<ironi>	if you right click in the channel
<ironi>	configure/options/kanos options
<new_gregh>	right click in the black window?
<ironi>	uncheck any box checked on the lower half on the middle section
<ironi>	yeah in the channel window you are talking in
<new_gregh>	there aren't checkboxes, just hierarchical menus...
<ironi>	well in the menu ther eis configure -> options -> kanos options
<ironi>	there i would recommend to unchek all boxes in the lower half on th emiddle section, like reprt fatal erros and so on
<gregh>	ok, I've got that up now
<ironi>	also set "autoaway" to "off", and "on nick highlight" to "echo in focused"
<ironi>	the hit ok
<gregh>	good god what a bunch of options...!!
<ironi>	then
<ironi>	yeah there is A LOT more
<ironi>	if you want
<ironi>	but you dont need to
<gregh>	ok, did all that
<ironi>	done?
<ironi>	ok
<new_gregh>	yep, here I am
<ironi>	configure -> options -> modules options
<ironi>	check automatically log all channels to dir
<gregh>	geez a zillion more options
<ironi>	its a grwat fnction that sorts logs , channels in one dir and querys (private conversations) in one
<new_gregh>	done
<ironi>	configure -> options -> addons options
<gregh>	ok
<ironi>	remove the bottow five checkboxes
<ironi>	they are annoying
<ironi>	well actually
<new_gregh>	done
<ironi>	if u want spellfix, keep it
<ironi>	i cant use it since i talk in swedish in some channels
<new_gregh>	no spell fix for now, I never make a mistrake ;-)
<ironi>	ok and now
<ironi>	mistrake
<ironi>	and now something
<ironi>	type /ncomp &n:
<new_gregh>	what?
<ironi>	 /ncomp &n:
<new_gregh>	I did that
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	new_gregh: This is what the nick comp is set to!
<ironi>	thats what u got?
<new_gregh>	yes
<ironi>	cause that is nick completion
<ironi>	try typing ir:
<ironi>	still there?
<new_gregh>	ironi:
<ironi>	you see?
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	you can also try ir and press tab
<ironi>	it will complete the nick
<new_gregh>	ironi
<ironi>	kinda handy
<ironi>	for long nicks
<new_gregh>	what does the &n mean?
<ironi>	oh that was how it would complete
<ironi>	 &n is the nick and :
<new_gregh>	OH I get it now... nick completion is nick followed by :
<new_gregh>	I said I'm new...
<ironi>	exactly
<ironi>	so i change my

<ironi>	dunno
<ironi>	try /help ncomp
<new_gregh>	I'm going to change new_gregh back to gregh but can't since I'm running two clients right now

<ironi>	and a few other things
<ironi>	the "console"
<ironi>	you cna actually try yourself b using /kano
<gregh>	well, it's not too exciting over here
<ironi>	like /kano 0
*	ironi is testing
<gregh>	I set a prompt
<ironi>	hm
*	ironi is testing
<gregh>	but don't see the prompt...
<ironi>	well its just when messgaes appear form the server, and so on
<ironi>	nevermind
<gregh>	that's ok, thanks
<ironi>	so anyway
<ironi>	you can do /ts
<ironi>	to get itmestamp
<gregh>	good
<ironi>	you have to do it individually for every channel
<ironi>	try pressing the little button with tools on top
<ironi>	you have a time format
<ironi>	you might want to change the time display layout
<gregh>	I see, my god what a configurable program
<ironi>	i have [%H:%M]
<ironi>	and also connecta t startup
<ironi>	might be handy
<gregh>	I set the connect at startup
<ironi>	now
<gregh>	well, before I go to bed tonight, I'll see if Linux or Bjorn are on
<ironi>	 is this highlighted gregh
<gregh>	yes
<ironi>	good.
<ironi>	actually, minimize this program and look at your keyboard lamps
<ironi>	try that now
<ironi>	gregh
<ironi>	gregh
<ironi>	cool, isnt it?
<ironi>	gregh
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	wow
<ironi>	the scroll lock is blinking , right?
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	yes
<ironi>	i think that rocks, when im doing something else i can see someone needs me
<gregh>	how do you know if its addressed to you, or just the channel?
<ironi>	well kano is porlly the most complicated tcl script there is for irc
<ironi>	well it blinks when your name is said
<ironi>	thats the only occasion
<gregh>	oh my god
<ironi>	or when someone wites osmething to you in a private window
<ironi>	writes
<gregh>	and here I thought it was just when a message came through of any kind ...
<ironi>	no no
<ironi>	its a bit more sofisticated
<ironi>	anyway you can do most kano commands and options with / , you dnt have to use menus, which i think is handy
<gregh>	well, I better get something to eat and you better sleep...
<ironi>	if yu want to explore all the commands try typing /help
<gregh>	I will read up on this complicated thing...
<ironi>	and look onwards from there
<gregh>	I'll just leave this running, though
<ironi>	the commands that you do with / are called aliases btw
<ironi>	hehe do that
<ironi>	now waut
<ironi>	wait
<ironi>	try this /away food
*	gregh is away, food [l/on p/on]
*	ironi is gone, sleeping [l/on p/on]
<ironi>	=)
<gregh>	am I awa?
<ironi>	yep
<gregh>	away?
*	gregh has returned, [gone/1m 26s]
<gregh>	how do you get the private window?
<ironi>	you double click a user in the list
<ironi>	or if you want to do it the command line way you type /msg nickname text
<ironi>	the reply will still open up a new window
<gregh>	ok, I'm going to eat now, thanks alot for the info!
<ironi>	np
*	gregh is away, food+drinking [l/on p/on]
<ironi>	kano is huge, takes forever to learn all the nifty email-checkers and other built-in utils
<gregh>	s u later
<ironi>	but a tip is to rght click and  go on help->aliases
<ironi>	ok take care
<ironi>	
<ironi>	
<ironi>	gregh: do u use emacs?
<gregh>	no
<ironi>	xircon supports some of it
<ironi>	ok
<gregh>	I'm a VI man
<ironi>	i think björn does
<ironi>	i have to tell him about it, i just found out
<ironi>	i haver used kano for 4 years, i keep finding new stuff
<ironi>	haha
<gregh>	isn't it about 3:30 in the morning now?
<ironi>	oh damn =)
<ironi>	i have to be up at 8
<ironi>	bye =)

<PsycoXul>	hmm
<PsycoXul>	http://www.sciplus.com/singleItem.cfm?terms=6609
<PsycoXul>	are those too long? heh
<PsycoXul>	heh well... i guess they are
<PsycoXul>	thats kinda... heh
<dwihno>	Hmm, looks fishy
<PsycoXul>	well i measured my batteries
<PsycoXul>	they're only 2" 
<PsycoXul>	those are 9/16" longer
<PsycoXul>	heh
<dwihno>	Well, you can always re-design your player to make it accept the bigger batteries ;)
<dwihno>	What kind of archos do you haev?
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	studio20
<adi|home>	gregh: about your logs question
<adi|home>	we have some of the irc conversation logs on the web site
<adi|home>	but no _everything_
<adi|home>	and i met an ex on irc too ;)
<adi|home>	well.. chat room.. not irc ;)
<dwihno>	Does the archos firmware ever bug (major bugs, that is) for you?
<dwihno>	adi|home: internet is not for real(tm) :)
<adi|home>	dunno... havent' used it on my recorder
<PsycoXul>	well adding a whole dir to a playlist adds through to the end of the disk or more usualy the 999 limit
<adi|home>	thats not true dwihno
<adi|home>	we talked on line for 6 months or so...
<dwihno>	adi|home: The internet has you!
<adi|home>	talked on the phone for another 4
<PsycoXul>	its a nice feature but not as nice as one that stops at the end of the dir :p
<adi|home>	then met in real life
<dwihno>	adi|home: nobody can be told what the internet is, you have to see it yourself! :)
<PsycoXul>	and the 999 limit's real annoying on a 20G drive
<adi|home>	we're 'togeather' for about a year
<dwihno>	PsycoXul: true, true
<PsycoXul>	the menus are a little random in their behaviour... they often don't return to where you expect them to
<PsycoXul>	heh
<gregh>	adi|home: which log question?
-->	g003y (~foo@m198-187.dsl.rawbw.com) has joined #rockbox
<adi|home>	asking if there was a master list to irc
<gregh>	oh yes, I was going to see if catching up on irc logs was worthwhile
<adi|home>	i think just diving into the code and asking questions is your best shot
<dwihno>	adi|home: The internet has you!!! :O
<adi|home>	find something you want to fix/do and do it
<adi|home>	hehe damn right dwihno
<adi|home>	i mud
<adi|home>	i code
<adi|home>	i research
<adi|home>	i purchase
<adi|home>	i bank

<adi|home>	Bagder you check your mail recently?
<Bagder>	checking now
<adi|home>	k
<adi|home>	i want to know what you think of the guys question about his 'Archos Jukebox 6000'
<adi|home>	and my response, and then his response.
*	adi|home is feeling a bit peeved.
<dwihno>	Good morning Dr. Bagder 
<g003y>	you mean the "mp3 no id3 info bug" one?
<Bagder>	his previous responses to other mails has proved him to be a bit "trigger happy" when it comes to reacting on mail content
<adi|home>	k...
<adi|home>	um.. am i out off line wanting to respond with 'fuck you'
<adi|home>	i won't..
<g003y>	trigger happy... more like instant asshole.  just add internet
<adi|home>	but im just asking
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<adi|home>	I mean.. am i wrong that his email doesn't make it obvious that he is using a studio?
<PsycoXul>	honestly i dunno what mp3 playback not working on the recorder has to do with a "No mp3 id info" message on a jukebox 6k...
*	adi|home wonders if he is supposed to have the _entire_ archos line memorized
<PsycoXul>	uh?
<g003y>	ya know what... don't waste anymore cycles on him.  He can't even get on this irc server
<PsycoXul>	i think the lists getting too much crap lately
<adi|home>	am i correct in thinking that there is no archos 6000 recorder?
<PsycoXul>	10 emails just with or about ones with viruses all pretty much at once
<adi|home>	yeah.. but those were automated
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Bagder>	adi; yes, the 6GB recorder is named "Recorder 6"
<PsycoXul>	is it?
<Bagder>	I think so
<Bagder>	hm
<Bagder>	or perhaps not
<g003y>	never seen on the site myself
<PsycoXul>	well they're not called "Jukebox 6000"s i'm pretty sure
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Bagder>	no, that's for sure at least
<adi|home>	so are there 2 versions?
<Bagder>	of recorders?
<g003y>	http://www.archos.com/us/products/product_jbrecorders.html
<PsycoXul>	first there was the jukebox 6000
<PsycoXul>	the first player
<PsycoXul>	and then later they came out with the recorder
<g003y>	wow there is one.... never noticed before
<PsycoXul>	which was also initialy 6G i think
*	adi|home nods
<PsycoXul>	and the 20G versions and the 10G versions
<PsycoXul>	and best buy has had some 5G version of something too
<Bagder>	there are players: 6000/5000 Jukbox, Studio 10 and 20, Recorder 6, 10 and 20.
*	gregh is gone, sleep [l/on p/on]
<Bagder>	there's a 5GB recorder?
<PsycoXul>	i only know of the jukebox 5000 for 5GB
<PsycoXul>	i dunno
<adi|home>	might i spam the channel for a sec with my response before I send it just to him?
*	adi|home waits for a descenting vote
<PsycoXul>	die!
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Bagder>	you want my opinion? don't reply at all.
<adi|home>	but but but... he needs a spanking
<PsycoXul>	what for
<adi|home>	cause i responded to offer and answer to his question
<adi|home>	and he was a dick
*	adi|home gets all pouty
<g003y>	just email him this
<g003y>	http://www.amishrakefight.org/gfy/
<g003y>	classic
<adi|home>	lol
<PsycoXul>	well
<adi|home>	no no no...
<PsycoXul>	i wonder if you even read his question
<PsycoXul>	because honestly your answer had nothing to do with it in the least
<PsycoXul>	:p
<adi|home>	it does if you think about it
<PsycoXul>	he mentioned nothing about music playback for one thing
<PsycoXul>	he was talking about id3 info display
<adi|home>	think abou it...
<adi|home>	no.. he states thats the prob
<adi|home>	if you _know_ that music won't play
<adi|home>	why try and play an mp3?
<adi|home>	thats what i was pointing out
*	adi|home wonders if that made sense
<PsycoXul>	and the other thing is he said "jukebox 6000" which is all over the place on the web page and other places as being a player and the first target and having music playback working 
<adi|home>	right, but how many emails do we get describing 'jukebox'
<PsycoXul>	and even if music playback doesn't work, why should that stop somebody from testing id3 info display?
<adi|home>	because he didn't state he was testing the id3 display
<adi|home>	he didn't state anything other then 'is this a bug'
<PsycoXul>	well gee i dunno 
<adi|home>	and i was responding that if he was trying to _play_ music.. then no its not a bug
<PsycoXul>	asking about the display of the message "No mp3 id info" seems to imply something about id3 display
<g003y>	regardless no reason to snap like a pitbull reading usenet
<adi|home>	" but when
<adi|home>	I tried to play some other, real, mp3file"
<g003y>	"he's snapping at me.  He's stripped his teeth"
<adi|home>	is he exact statemnt
<adi|home>	thats why i asked
<PsycoXul>	he said he selected a non-mp3 file by mistake, got a no id3 info message, then went to a mp3 file and still got the no id3 message
<PsycoXul>	and has to reboot to get the id3 info from an mp3 file
<PsycoXul>	it sounds like a bug to me
<adi|home>	right...
<adi|home>	but was it the rebooting.. or the display he was asking about...
<adi|home>	so thats what i was pointing out
<PsycoXul>	it sounds like he was dropping an e-mail about the bug...
<adi|home>	and franklky.. if he doesn't know enough to read that playback isn't playing on a recorder, then he doens't know enough to figure out how to leave the display
<adi|home>	but _which_ 'bug'
<PsycoXul>	heh
<adi|home>	thats my point
<PsycoXul>	the bug of id3 info not being displayed after having selected a non-mp3 file
<PsycoXul>	kindof a silly one i admit, but something that might be looked into :p
<adi|home>	but if its a recorder.. then its not a 'bug
<Bagder>	weird bug it is
<adi|home>	if your ead the website ;)
<adi|home>	read rather
<PsycoXul>	sure it is
<PsycoXul>	as i understand it the recorder shouldn't have a problem displaying id3 info
<PsycoXul>	even if you don't get music playback
<g003y>	what if you select a non-mp3 file? :D
<PsycoXul>	since he didn't even mention music playback though i don't think its worth worrying about in that respect
<PsycoXul>	and since he did say explicitly "Archos Jukebox 6000" which is also on the website as having music playback
<PsycoXul>	if you're intent on people reading the website
<PsycoXul>	:p
<g003y>	hehehehehe
<adi|home>	heheh true
<PsycoXul>	i'd have to agree with bagder and just drop it
<g003y>	I'd say that is your best route.
<adi|home>	yeah.. but pimp slapping is so much more fun. :)
<PsycoXul>	maybe but not really the purpose of the mailing list
<PsycoXul>	which, like i said before, is starting to get too much crap already as it is
<adi|home>	i know.. thats why i wasn't going to send to the list
<adi|home>	to him ;)
<adi|home>	if you read irc ;)
<PsycoXul>	ah well have fun if you want to
<g003y>	dang where is that old send a bitch slap site when you need it :D
<PsycoXul>	its your choice of course :p
<g003y>	if his is on the list long enough maybe he will get the klez virus.  
<g003y>	his == he
<g003y>	I wonder who the heck keeps sending that damn thing to the list anyway.
<Bagder>	someone on the list is infected
<adi|home>	i really need to get my hands on a player
<Bagder>	there are ~166 suspects ;-)
<adi|home>	i blame it on the 'instant asshole'
<adi|home>	but hey, thats just me
<adi|home>	wow.. that many ?
<g003y>	hahahah
<--	gregh has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<g003y>	well make it ~165 cuz it ain't me :D
<adi|home>	64
<Bagder>	haha
<adi|home>	164
<g003y>	I scanned for grins even
<Bagder>	wc -l /home/majordom/lists/rockbox
<Bagder>	    162 /home/majordom/lists/rockbox
<Bagder>	I've suggested we lower the maximum mail size we allow to the list
<adi|home>	i swear.. i think archos choose the AA cable so that you _had- to buy them through them.. cause i can't find them anywhere
<Bagder>	it should stop most klezes
<adi|home>	im all for it
<g003y>	I got an extra AA fairly easy
<g003y>	but that was when I first picked up the _jukebox 6000_
<adi|home>	ive looke everywhere
<adi|home>	best buy, compusa, radio shack
<g003y>	ugh... those places never have them
<g003y>	on line
*	adi|home noticed
<g003y>	I ordered
<adi|home>	ahh.. okay
<adi|home>	I just got my Atari today :)
<adi|home>	hehe 2600 baby...
<g003y>	how many carts?
<adi|home>	im at 20 or so
<g003y>	nice
<adi|home>	now i just need a converted for my tv
<adi|home>	i don't have the vhf clips on this tv :)
<g003y>	ratshack should have that
<adi|home>	know what sucks...
<g003y>	oh
<adi|home>	it was in perfect condition
<adi|home>	got a small chunk taken outta the edge in transit
<g003y>	damn....
<adi|home>	the 3 small chips were in the box when i got it..
<adi|home>	yeah :(
<g003y>	was that an ebay purchase?
<adi|home>	yup
<adi|home>	and the packing was very good
<adi|home>	that was the sucky thing
<g003y>	was it UPS or USPS?
<adi|home>	USPS
<adi|home>	priotiry insured
<g003y>	hmmm....
<g003y>	I think they actually take the package when they pay out on a clain
<g003y>	clain == claim
<adi|home>	ick
<adi|home>	im not claiming..
<adi|home>	im keeping this...
<adi|home>	only a small chip
<g003y>	if it works then don't bother
<g003y>	get a tv card, and mod that mofo onto your pc case :D
<adi|home>	lol
<g003y>	you get all the joysticks?
<g003y>	paddles
<g003y>	?
<adi|home>	2 sticks
<adi|home>	and 4 paddles
<adi|home>	i just need the ones with keypads
<g003y>	I thought those were Intellivision
*	adi|home nods
<adi|home>	but if i remember atari made them as well
<adi|home>	but im not positive
<g003y>	well coleco had them too
<g003y>	but only the rich kids had coleco :D
<adi|home>	hehehe
<g003y>	maybe that is a generalization, but I definitely couldn't afford one & I wasn't rich 
<adi|home>	i was crushed when i talked to my nephew.. and i showed him pics of the atari screens
<adi|home>	he just went 'eww.. whats that?'
