<dwihno>	Cool!
<dwihno>	:D
<dwihno>	Beware of Rockbox - It will rock your box! :D
<Zagor>	http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/download.html
<dwihno>	You are forgetting something - I have a recorder ;)
<Zagor>	ah, i'll add a comment about that
<dwihno>	I want to be mentioned too! :)
<Zagor>	hehe
<dwihno>	Please? :)
<webmind>	it seems to be becomming something :)
<dwihno>	I saw a 1.27D version of the archos firmware being released
*	dwihno is off to check what's new/fixed
<Zagor>	dwihno: any info about what changes?
<dwihno>	Added all Remote Functions via Remote Control Unit 
<dwihno>	That's what's new in the D revision
<Zagor>	ok
<dwihno>	I got some new Sennheiser headphones today
<dwihno>	My old Philips died on me last night. May they rest in peace.
<webmind>	btw.. any chance there will sometime be a txt file reader in rockbox ?
<dwihno>	Sometime, probably
<webmind>	ok
<Zagor>	yeah, that's a simple thing
<Zagor>	PsycoXul was working on it yesterday, but got snagged on some bug
<dwihno>	Does the ID3 stuff parse ID3V2 tags?
<Zagor>	i think so
<dwihno>	mkay

<Zagor>	you got that too?
<edx>	yup.
<Zagor>	hah
<edx>	what is wrong with the ata driver?
<edx>	a protocol related thing.. ?
<Zagor>	no, more likely the hardware interface is a little different from the players
<edx>	hmm

<Zagor>	no, it's up again

<huz>	hi all, glade to see the first release it there, i test it now ! 
<huz>	congratulations
<huz>	(where is my archos ? ;)
<Zagor>	thanks!
---	huz is now known as huz|test
<huz|test>	befor i copy your archos.mod, i must ark you somthing : 
<huz|test>	i'll already try to make : 'mv /mnt/archos/archos.mod ~/' and my computer freezed (sorry for my english ;)
<huz|test>	do you know why ? 
<Zagor>	did it really freeze? it can take several minutes to copy the first file to/from the archos, due to it having to read the disk's FAT
<huz|test>	qok, i musted be impatient .. i try .. hoping i'll stay alive
<huz|test>	oh oh .. i've lot of 'Jun  2 19:08:23 debian kernel: SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 return code = 70000

<Zagor>	ouch, that doesn't look good
<Zagor>	which usb driver are you using?
<huz|test>	euhh .. UHCI i think, i verify
<Zagor>	uchi.o or usb-uhci.o ?
<Zagor>	you should not be using uhci.o
<huz|test>	ohci sorry
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	what chipset are you using?
<Zagor>	have you got usb working for any other devices?
<huz|test>	yes my usb works for my Speedtouch ADSL modem
<Zagor>	ok
<huz|test>	but normally it works well
<huz|test>	:)

<Zagor>	edx: are you here?
<Zagor>	can anyone build win32 simulators for me to put on the web page?
<edx>	zagor.. yes i am
<edx>	i can.
<Zagor>	good. download the 1.0 release and build that. one player sim and one recorder
<edx>	the new design of the page is cool btw ;)
<Zagor>	yeah. it's ironi's design
<edx>	shall i take the latest simulator code with the 1.0 app code or shall i also take 1.0 simulator code?
<Zagor>	the 1.0 release contains everything, so use that
<edx>	there's the uisw32.rc file missing in the 1.0 archive.
<Zagor>	uh, bad.
<edx>	it should be in cvs though
<Zagor>	yes
<edx>	.. and button.c is not yet player compatible..
<edx>	(shall i take the new one for compilation?)
<Zagor>	it isn't?
<Zagor>	is the simulator player compatible as a whole?
<Zagor>	if 1.0 only supports recorder, only build recorder
<edx>	it only supports the recorder...
<Zagor>	ok, no problem. just build that then.
<edx>	it is player compatible now (i only miss a player ui.. hehe other wise the simulator looks like a recorder even for the player)
<edx>	can i send the file via irc?
<Zagor>	sure
<edx>	do you get the request?
<Zagor>	yes, but not the file
<edx>	huh?
<Zagor>	mail it to me instead
<Zagor>	maybe it's my firewall
<edx>	yup
<edx>	(or my server?)
<edx>	do you have a front picture of a player?
<Zagor>	sure, on the devcon page
<edx>	ok.. got it..
<edx>	ill have a player design for the simulator in the next few days then ;)
<Zagor>	nice
<edx>	where exactly fails the ata driver for the recorder?
<Zagor>	when we try to send a command to it
<edx>	so it wont even initialize.. ?
<Zagor>	no
<edx>	hmm
<edx>	that is bad.
<Zagor>	we are going to add a serial port to our recorders this week and start experimenting
<edx>	hehe
<edx>	did you receive the mail yet?
<Zagor>	yes, got it
<edx>	ok

<huz>	okback under win
<Zagor>	ok
<huz>	nice !:)
<huz>	first time i see the red led :)
<Zagor>	hehe, yes archos never uses it for some reason
<huz>	the sound now .. .
<Zagor>	problems?
<huz>	no, it works perfectly
<Zagor>	good
<huz>	do you want i make something ? a test  or wathever ..
<Zagor>	do you have a new or old player?
<Zagor>	that is, did you download the player-old or player version?
<huz>	i've an archos JB600 , but how can i know if i have 'an old' or 'a new' player
<huz>	the player version 
<huz>	not the old
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	the ROM firmware version decides
<huz>	great we can exit the dir and the sound continue to play ! it'sgreat
<Zagor>	so how did you like the big rockbox logo on boot?
<huz>	euh .. there is a blank line in the midle of Rockbox
<Zagor>	yeah, but I think it's cool anyway :)
<huz>	vers 5.03 <- my firmware
<Zagor>	yeah, that's a new player
<huz>	yes logo is great, but isn't it possible to have a music's note (une note de musique ?) 
<huz>	:)
<huz>	(ok ok .. i'll wait :)
<Zagor>	yeah it is
<Zagor>	next version :)
<huz>	i return under linux, i have a strange impression to be observed when i work w/ windows
<huz>	:)
<webmind>	hmm
*	webmind has 5.08
<--	huz (huz@AToulouse-103-1-2-61.abo.wanadoo.fr) has left #rockbox ("Client Exiting")
<webmind>	quite odd
<Zagor>	what?
<webmind>	firmware 5.08
<webmind>	since newest online 5.07a
<Zagor>	that's not unusual. they don't release the mod files very quickly
<webmind>	ah ok
<Zagor>	every new release is first released in ROM and then (weeks later) as mod files
<webmind>	hm k
<Zagor>	I don't know why, but that's what they do
<webmind>	hm k
<webmind>	hope rockbox will develop soon.. archos firmware getting anoying as hell
<Zagor>	i think we will go far this summer. I will work on it almost full-time!

<Bagder>	there's currently 128kb available for malloc()
<Lion>	No, the standard block that doesn't fragment
<Bagder>	ah
<Bagder>	well
<Bagder>	its not that easy to say just one size, but if there's any size that matches that description it is 4064 bytes ;-)

---	huz is now known as huz|sdl

<Bagder>	so tell me! ;-)

<Bagder>	just remember that we need deterministic shuffle

<Bagder>	recorder build is broken again :-(
<dwihno>	Doesn't really matter since the code won't run on the target platform (yet) ;)

<Bagder>	we should deal nicely with small playlists too of course

<huz|sdl>	why in id3.c fonction stripspaces() you don't realloc the buffer ? is it a speed problem ? (i warn i'm not a quite brillant programmer)
<Bagder>	id3 doesn't use malloc() at all
<adam>	Heh, 2:36 AM
<Bagder>	we rather avoid malloc() and associated functions if possible
<dwihno>	is the malloc stuff slow?
<huz|sdl>	ok it is thus a speed limitation ?

<huz|sdl>	:)
<Bagder>	actually
<Bagder>	using malloc() in this kind of system is really a sensitive matter
<Bagder>	so if we know what kind of memory sizes to use and we know it'll be used fairly often, it is better to use static buffers
<Bagder>	I don't think this malloc() is slowe than other malloc()s, in fact I believe it is faster than most (best-fit) implementations
<Bagder>	it might have a slightly higher amount of internal fragementation though
<huz|sdl>	ok thanks
<Bagder>	also, I made the id3.c work before we even had a malloc() working ;-)
<dwihno>	malloc is for chickens
<dwihno>	real men use static buffers :)
<Bagder>	>500 unread mail this morning
<dwihno>	eww
<Bagder>	quite some load
<dwihno>	that's what happens when you subscribe to pr0n bulletins ;)

<dwihno>	Eww
<dwihno>	That much mail in 4 days?
<Bagder>	yah

<dwihno>	That's perverted :)
<Bagder>	I'm involved in a fair amount of open source projects
<dwihno>	That's what I get in three years :)
<dwihno>	What mail client do you use?
<dwihno>	I bet you have 3000 filtering rules
<Bagder>	I subscribe to at least 4-5 cvs commit mailing lists
<Bagder>	I have 13 inboxes
<Bagder>	I get 150-170 mails daily
<dwihno>	What client?
<dwihno>	Pine?
<Bagder>	pine
<dwihno>	Mkay
<dwihno>	I think mutt is cute
<Lion>	Pine rocks

<Bagder>	hey Linus
<Bagder>	good to not have Björn around? ;-P
<Linus>	nice and quiet
<green>	there was talk recently of removing sh-1 support from gcc.
<green>	I think a number of people complained, but I'm not sure what the final decision was.
<dwihno>	Hmm...
<dwihno>	Why would they remove it?
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
<Linus>	dwihno: maybe because it isn't a very popular CPU?

<Lion>	Ok, you want to read this thing?
<Bagder>	machine died
<dwihno>	Linus: But why would they dump the support for an architecture they already have code for?
<Lion>	dwihno: THey have to maintain it.
<Linus>	maybe because they have changed their internal scheduler?
<dwihno>	Hm
<dwihno>	Linus: True, ture
<Lion>	http://www.leonine.com/~lion/temp/playlist.txt
<dwihno>	Lion Templin reminds me of Simon Templar
<Lion>	Heh.
<green>	no - because apparently sh-1 support has been broken since September 2001.
<green>	And nobody has bothered to fix it.
<dwihno>	Lion - the saint
*	dwihno listens to the saint theme
<Linus>	green: not exactly broken, but not entirely functional...
<green>	I'm just reading up on it.  I don't think their complaint impacts this project.
<green>	GCC's default crt0 uses braf in some assembly, but that instruction isn't available on sh-1.
<green>	rockbox doesn't use gcc's crt0, right?
<Linus>	no, we have our own
<dwihno>	Evil shiznat 1x2.
<green>	How much ram on these devices?
<Bagder>	2MB
<Bagder>	and we need as much as possible for mp3 buffering
<adam>	heh
<dwihno>	The memory consumption should be kept to a minumum allowing buff... yeah, exactly what Bagder says....
<Lion>	Bagder: You read that URL?
<Bagder>	no, I'll do that
<adam>	heh, does the buffer automatically read into the next file, like lets say you had a playlist, or does it start out anew with each opened file?
<Bagder>	it gets fed with the next file
<adam>	hmm
<Bagder>	or files if they are small
<adam>	It'd be an amusingly sadistic hardware hack to have a 64mb Buffer :p
<adam>	impossible, but amusing in any regards
<Bagder>	Lion: small first detail: write() will be supported, it just isn't right now

<Bagder>	Zagor: how many mp3s do you have on your archos?
<Bagder>	you're the worst case I know ;-)
*	Bagder wonders what a static buffer for the playlist would take
<webmind>	few k ?
<Zagor>	Bagder: about 3500-4000 files
<webmind>	files ?
<Zagor>	mp3 files, on my archos
<Zagor>	green: no, we haven't been bitten by that
<webmind>	owh.. i though on mem
<webmind>	+t
<Bagder>	so 10000 files would go pretty far and only take 40000 bytes
<Zagor>	sounds good
<dwihno>	yeah, sounds pretty good
<webmind>	40k ?
<Bagder>	almost
<Lion>	little more, but close
<Lion>	I'm going to send my doc to the list.

<Lil_Missie>	yes you were
<Zagor>	Bagder: reading now
<Bagder>	Zagor: you gonna keep this setup for the rockbox CVS commit mails?
<green>	is the firmware size limit really 200k?  any idea why not more?
<Bagder>	green: probably only the intial loaded file
<Bagder>	green: once we have a rolo we can load whatever size we want
<green>	rolo?
<Bagder>	Rockbox Loader
<Bagder>	like lilo
<Zagor>	Bagder: you mean cvs@haxx?
<Bagder>	Zagor: yes
<Zagor>	no, that was just temporary
<dwihno>	rolo! :D
<Bagder>	Zagor: I just wanna know for my procmail filtering
<dwihno>	ROLO WILL OWN! :D
<Zagor>	Bagder: ah
<green>	I'm confused then.  does rolo exist?
<Zagor>	green: no
<green>	can it exist?
<Zagor>	yes, it's something we plan to write
<Bagder>	green: no, but it would be cool to have a tiny little app loaded first, that can offer the user to load any of set of images
<green>	ok
<green>	I hack on gcj (the gnu java compiler), and I was looking for a fun embedded target to use for J2ME tests.  I might need more that 200k though.
<Bagder>	the 200k limit is only for the file the firmware loads
<Lion>	Haha, java on the archos would be great.
<webmind>	no
<Bagder>	I mean the original ROMed firmware
<Zagor>	i have to run som errands. see you later guys!
<--	Zagor has quit ("bye")
<Lion>	So, about that file?
<Lion>	Any comments?
<green>	I've just created binutil/gcc patches to create an sh-rockbox target.
<green>	I need this to configure the java runtime properly.
<webmind>	btw is the rom overwriteable ?
<green>	I don't know if this would be useful to anybody though.
<Bagder>	webmind: some revisions of the hardware do offer this capability, but don't expect us to attempt that ;-)
<green>	Is there a plan to use more threads in the firmware?
<webmind>	heh
<green>	I think I only see 1 being created.
<Bagder>	green: if we need to
<green>	The gcc hackers are adding compiler support for thread local storage.
<Bagder>	cool
<green>	An sh-rockbox configuration would be necessary in order for it to work on this project.
<green>	Maybe that's a good argument to check this in.
<Bagder>	I'm not sure we need any particular thread local storage at this point :-)
<Bagder>	we might need that in the future though of course

<Linus>	well, not really

<edx>	talked about it with bagder.. he mentioned rolo then.
<edx>	when has the post been put up on slashdot?

<edx>	lol some stupid stuff ppl write sometimes ... :)

<wiggles>	I quote
<wiggles>	<< Q18. What about supporting playing of wav files?
<wiggles>	A18. No Bill.  We have no intention of that.  Go buy your own project. >>
<wiggles>	this makes very little sense. wav files, though they originated with windows, are very well documented at the moment. it would make more sense if it said "wma files" or "asf files"
<wiggles>	also, wav files do not compete directly with mp3 files. wma files however do directly compete with mp3 files

<adi|home>	i do think i did do a good job making that FAQ nice and sarcasm ladden if i do say so myself
<Bagder>	hehe, I agree
<adi|home>	hehe you see all the DMCA comments?
<Bagder>	yeah
<Bagder>	almost every second posting seems to mention that in one way or another
<adi|home>	i like this:
<adi|home>	ust tried the mod out, works great on my Studio 20, of course the UI has quite a bit till it's up to the current archos build, but it's good to see someone making progress. 
<adi|home>	             the cool thing about these players it you don't have to actually flash the rom, they boot off of the internal rom for a second and immediately look for a file in the root for updates, if
<adi|home>	             the file's not there they just continue to boot from hardware. 
<adi|home>	heheh
<adi|home>	and i also dig the fact that the FAQ is actually being useful :)
<adi|home>	way to go Bagder
<Bagder>	slashdot is likely to be a very good place to get attention

<Bagder>	I wanna know too!
<Bagder>	http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pascal.brisset/kernel3d/kernel3d.html
<Bagder>	we should have one of those for rockbox ;-)
<Lion>	So, Bagder, you never really commented on the rest of the doc I submitted ...
<Bagder>	you mean the "caching" and the saving parts?
<Lion>	That, and the assumed acceptance of the byte-offset method for storing list entries.
<Bagder>	the byte-offset method is already used in the playlist code we have ;-)
<Bagder>	and I like that approach
-->	globbe (~59@as1-2-5.n.n.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	we will benefit from a cache system too, to avoid reading from the disk more than necessary
<Lion>	Well, hell, if I'm just repeating what's been said before, *shrug*
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	only partly
<Bagder>	the current code loads a playlist and creates a single index with all byte-positions for all file names
<Bagder>	and it offers a randomizer
<Bagder>	I don't think we need to store the cache on save though
<Lion>	I never talked about doing that.
<Bagder>	no
<Bagder>	saving needs to save the random seed to
<Bagder>	too
<Lion>	Not everyone shuffles.
<Bagder>	true, but for those who do
<globbe>	sorry if this is an obvious question, but will the firmware work with my jukebox recorder 20?
<Bagder>	globbe: it _will_, it just don't do it right now ;-)
<globbe>	haha :)
<globbe>	looking forward to that :)
<Bagder>	globbe: we do have a simulator running though
<Bagder>	yeah, I do too
<Bagder>	I only have a recorder myself ;-)
<globbe>	youve done a beautiful job :)
<Lion>	ok
<Lion>	mav
<globbe>	I'm just about to order the ACCESSORY KIT, to get the remote.. is it worth the money?

<Bagder>	no, not yet
<Bagder>	still some problemos on the ata driver there
<dwihno>	But it's progressing! :)
<dwihno>	Progress ! Yay!
<Hadaka>	well I can try some test versions whenever those would come around
<Bagder>	we'll announce them on the mailing list and the web site as soon as we have any
<Hadaka>	have to see if I would manage to squeeze some time from other project to code a bit on this
<Bagder>	we always appreciate more hands in the cookie jar ;-)
<Hadaka>	hm, you've implemented fat filesystem code yourself there?
<Bagder>	yes
<Hadaka>	hmmh, I wonder if it would be possible to have a small fat filesystem for bootstrapping the new firmware and then some other filesystem for the rest of the disk...
<Bagder>	yes it would
<Bagder>	at least some people have said so
<Hadaka>	I'm currently having some files as a big file containing ext3 that I'm mounting loopback
<dwihno>	Is there any limitation on the disk size btw?
<Bagder>	hm, it wouldn't surprise me if there is one
<dwihno>	I've read about upgrades to 40 gig

<adi|home>	hehe
<webmind_>	zoomed ?
<adi|home>	oh.. tetris used to be VERY small
<adi|home>	the pieces were 1 pixel wide
<adi|home>	so tought to work with...
<adi|home>	edx fixed that by increasing their size (as well as the size of the game board)

<webmind_>	so wide is your playing field btw?

<jedix>	sweet
<jedix>	jimperson: is that the actual size?
<Linus>	But definitely not a device for a skiing trip.
<jedix>	why is that?\
<jimperson>	ya know im not sure
<Linus>	The HD is somewhat shock sensitive
<Zagor>	well it has moving parts, so if you bump it around too much it will skip
<jedix>	really? so its not shock proof?
<Bagder>	if you'd wrap a *huuuge* pillow around the archos ;-)
<Linus>	or swallow it
<Zagor>	no hd players are really shock proof
<jedix>	2mb buffer isn't enough?
<Bagder>	I don't think they're talking about the buffering
<Zagor>	it depends on how rough you treat it
<jimperson>	is there an effective carrying case that would, say strap to my arm for jogging?
<Linus>	If you drop it while it is spinning, i guess you could even damage it...
<Linus>	I think it weighs too much for jogging
<Zagor>	jimperson: the included case only has a belt strap
<jedix>	yeah, if I run with it, will it skip?
<jedix>	Linus: more of a work out then :)
<jimperson>	which begs the question, how much does it weigh :)
<Zagor>	hard to say. I mountain bike with mine and only get rare skips 
<Linus>	yes, if you have it in the belt strap
<Zagor>	http://www.archos.com/us/products/product_jbrecorders.html
<Linus>	I run with it to catch the train
<jedix>	I hope I can find one in ottawa
<Linus>	and it skips if i have it in the belt strap
<dwihno>	Mine has never skipped
<Linus>	because the belt strap is loose
<jedix>	Linus: and your arms are.. a) as big as twigs b) steal gurders c) the train itself
<dwihno>	I always keep it in my special handthingy when I run
<jimperson>	aha! a custom special handthingy! exactly what i need :)
<Linus>	jedix: they are huge! :-)
<Linus>	as are all hacker arms
*	Zagor tries not to laugh
*	Bagder giggles as he can't resist
*	jedix runs to the bathroom to not piss himself
<jedix>	I think i'll get one for the hackability of it..
<jimperson>	she was so impressed by my special handthingy she could hardly contain herself
<Bagder>	jedix: that's what I did ;-)
<dwihno>	:)
<jedix>	work==boardom this workterm
<Linus>	I have two
<Zagor>	oooh, a contest!
<dwihno>	I made it myself (the handthingy)
<Linus>	Zagor has three
<Zagor>	i have three :)
<jimperson>	you gots pics of your handthingy?
<dwihno>	jimperson: no, but I'll fix0r :)
<elinenbe>	who was here talking about ROLO?
<jedix>	what does your firmware do right now?
<jimperson>	rolo? you mean lamont's friend from sanford and son?
<Linus>	jedix: it plays pm3's
<Linus>	mp3's
<Bagder>	and shows id3
<dwihno>	It also plays tetris
<dwihno>	(very important feature)
<Linus>	and says "rockbox" when you start it :-)
<jedix>	sweet
<Zagor>	dwihno: only the simulator right now
<elinenbe>	edx and I were talking last night, and what you can do is load a small ROLO firmware, and then have that load an uncompressed larger firmware.. this would reduce the boot up time
<dwihno>	Yeah, that must not be forgotten
<dwihno>	Zagor: OMG!
<jedix>	so its all the support the player has before the firmware change?
<Bagder>	elinenbe: yeps
<Zagor>	elinenbe: yes
<dwihno>	I think I'll start mass-producing the handthingy and get rich
<dwihno>	The design is really smart
<jedix>	dwihno: thats how I passed calc1-3
<elinenbe>	even the 5-10 second start up time feels kind of long.
<jimperson>	hey man, i would buy one. i believe handthingy.com is available...
<jedix>	dwihno: catchy name too.. handthingy.
<Bagder>	hehe
<Zagor>	elinenbe: 90% of the startup time is the Archos ROM firmware, not Rockbox
<dwihno>	Then I'll start the production in taiwan and hire youngsters to cut the salaries and get rich and fat
<elinenbe>	well,  that can not be changed now, can it?
<jimperson>	you could open your own sweatshop and mass produce them with cheap illegal immigrant labor...
<Linus>	elinenbe: not easily
<elinenbe>	I see.
<jedix>	i'm going to get myself a snack
<jedix>	brb
<jimperson>	mmm.. snak
<Zagor>	elinenbe: that would require flashing it, which is a whole new ballgame
<Bagder>	flashing this kind of things feels... well, a bit like pushing our luck ;-)
<elinenbe>	yes it is.
<elinenbe>	well, someday a rolo loader will be flashed, and then it will load our custom firmware.
<Bagder>	though I bet dwihno would be first in line for doing it :-)
<Linus>	:-)
<elinenbe>	if something went wrong there... goodbye jukebox.
<Bagder>	we'll let Björn do the testing, he has the largest amount of units ;-)
<Zagor>	hehe
<jimperson>	how is the download speed to the archos over usb?
*	Bagder whispers "usb2 rocks"
<jimperson>	yeah but i dont have usb2 on my powerbook
<Linus>	roughly 1mb/sec
<dwihno>	Bagder: How fast are the transfers?
<dwihno>	TO ALL YOUR HEADS... BLAST THE SPEAKERS!
<Bagder>	dwihno: I haven't actually measured
<Zagor>	with usb2 it's 4-8 MB/s
<dwihno>	Whoa
<dwihno>	Fucking amazing :)
<dwihno>	USB1 is good enough for me
<dwihno>	(until USB2 is standard, that is)
<Zagor>	that speed is limited by the archos, not usb2
<Linus>	Zagor: have you measured on a Windows machine?
<dwihno>	mkay
<dwihno>	good enough for me ;)
<Zagor>	Linus: no, i have never used my archoses with windows
<dwihno>	is it the disk speed or some interface which is setting the limit?
<Zagor>	dwihno: i'm not sure
<Linus>	I mean if the Linux USB implementation slows it down...
<Zagor>	could be either
<Linus>	dwihno: the ISD300 chipo ises PIO
<Linus>	uses
<Zagor>	Linus: that's possible, but I doubt you can get much above 10MB/s anyway
<Linus>	Probably not
<Bagder>	Zagor/Linus: my windows tests showed ~4 MB/s
<Linus>	lame
<Linus>	I must try it tonight
<Bagder>	some 15GB in about on hour
<Linus>	but do not try it on batteries...
<dwihno>	Linus: Hmm, PIO is no good
<Bagder>	not measured exactly so give or take a bunch 
<Linus>	dwihno: nope. But cheap
<dwihno>	True, true.
<dwihno>	We need some boot sounds too! :)
<dwihno>	Like some squeaky noise or something
<Zagor>	yeah, startup sound! wooooo :)
<dwihno>	Yeah!!! :D
<Zagor>	maybe we can ask Rolling Stones if they'll let us use one of their songs? ;)
<dwihno>	Hey, why is the startup-time for the archos so long? :)
<Linus>	Who wants to work on the sound effects for tetris?
<Zagor>	good question. it does a lot of disk scratching for very little apparent reason
<Linus>	dwihno: the recorder startup time is a pain
<Linus>	but the player is pretty short
-->	Kaze (~chaz@chaz6.com) has joined #rockbox
<Linus>	hey Kaze!
<jedix>	oh, now to find a place to buy one of these things..
<Linus>	go! go! go!
<Kaze>	oh sorry.. hi
<Linus>	Zagor: I guess the SPDIF is the way to go for the debugging port...?
<Zagor>	yep
<Linus>	I think I'll try that ASAP
<Zagor>	goodie
<Linus>	(ASAP means "maybe this month" :-)
<Zagor>	haha
<jedix>	damn, how can I search the net for a store with this?
<Zagor>	good question
<Kaze>	use... a search engine perhaps? :p
<Linus>	i search and search, and all i find is this damn Rockbox page...
<Zagor>	http://www.archos.com/us/archos_reseller.html
<jedix>	Kaze: didn't work too well
<Zagor>	jedix: is none of the listed ok?
<jedix>	Zagor: thanks, I'm there now
<Bagder>	http://www.funmp3players.com/ sells them too
<jimperson>	so $299 is pretty much the standard price on these eh?
<jimperson>	the 20 that is...
<Bagder>	seems so
<Zagor>	i think so, yes
<jedix>	i was at a place that only sold 6gbs and it was 350
<Zagor>	ouch!
<dwihno>	yeah, that was expensive!
<Zagor>	make sure you get a Recorder20 and not just a recorder with 20 gig disk.
<Zagor>	only the model called Recorder20 has usb2, the others have usb1.1
<Linus>	only the recorder20 has usb2.0
<Zagor>	it appears funmp3players sell upgraded recorders too, so make sure what you get before you order
<Linus>	Zagor: which reminds me...has anyone tried the Rockbox recorder firmware on a usb1.1 recorder???
<Zagor>	i don
<Zagor>	't know
<Zagor>	it would indeed be interesting
<Bagder>	hardly anyone has tried that, so I'd guess not
<Linus>	I can't blame them... :-)
<jedix>	$549.99 Archos Jukebox Studio Recorder 20 (thats canadian)
<Bagder>	do we even know anyone with such a device?
<jedix>	jebus thats high
<Zagor>	what
<Zagor>	's the can/usb rate?
<Zagor>	usd even :)
<Linus>	Bagder: we can fool jedix into buying one
<jedix>	usd == 336
<Bagder>	can/usb rates just has gotta be bus related ;-)
<Zagor>	hehe. gotta be 1:12 then
<Linus>	Bagder: you're a funny guy! :-)
<jedix>	Linus: what such device is this?
*	Bagder grins
<Linus>	jedix: a USB1.1 recorder
<jedix>	....
<Bagder>	we could ask on the list to see if we can find anyone
<Linus>	good idea
<jedix>	Archos Recorder 20 on sale this week only for $299 with free shipping*
<Zagor>	jedix: there are many models of archos jukebox: Archos Jukebox 5000, 6000, Studio 10, Studio 20, Recorder, Recorder 10 and Recorder 20
<Zagor>	jedix: sounds like an excellent offer
<jedix>	that has to be canadian
<--	jimperson has quit ("friends don't let friends listen to trance")
<jedix>	Zagor: yeah, I hear the recorder 20 is the best
<Zagor>	yup
<jedix>	linux compatable?
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	usb2 needs an extra patch though
<jedix>	then why the hell don't I have one?
<Zagor>	hehe
<Hadaka>	not too many motherboards come with usb 2.0 these days :(
<Bagder>	just buy a separate usb2 card
<Linus>	Hadaka: kt333
<Zagor>	they are just now starting to put usb2 in new motherboard chipset
<Zagor>	i wonder what took them so long :(
<Hadaka>	yeah well it's not like I'm buying a new motherboard anytime soon
<Linus>	A separate USB2.0 card works fine
<Zagor>	no, me neither. but I got myself a plugin card. it's worth it.
<jedix>	Canadian Residents add 7% GST Ontario Residents add 8% PST
<jedix>	damnit
<jedix>	i'm in ontario
<Linus>	tough luck
<jedix>	you don't need usb2
<jedix>	you can use 1.1
<Hadaka>	yeah, I'm living well enough with usb1.1 for now
<Zagor>	yeah, but waiting for transfers gets boring fast
<jedix>	it will be a bit slower
<jedix>	how slow is it?
<Linus>	"a bit"
<Linus>	1 mb/sec
<Zagor>	1.1 is 700-1000 kb/s, usb2 is 4-8 MB/s
<Hadaka>	well the thing that bothers me most is the waiting for the disk to spin up between all sorts of actions
<jedix>	Zagor: bits?
<Zagor>	yeah, we have a couple of ideas to avoid some of that
<Zagor>	jedix: bytes
<jedix>	kB
<Linus>	but it's something you'll have to live with
<Hadaka>	err, in USB mode?
<Linus>	the hard drive sucks batteries
<jedix>	thats not bad at all
<Zagor>	Hadaka: your disk spins down in usb mode?
<jedix>	Linus: ~10h playback though, right?
<Linus>	jedix: yup
<Hadaka>	well I'd say so, yes - I can hear it spinning up when I start reading
<Zagor>	strange. for me it spins constantly.
---	dwihno is now known as dw|gone
<Hadaka>	I've got 1.24 firmware in the flash rom for me
<Zagor>	same here
<Hadaka>	ok have to check it at home again to see if it really does that
<Zagor>	ok
<Hadaka>	think my work machine is compiled against the wrong UHCI driver - getting lockups with transfers
<Linus>	ouch!
<Zagor>	ah, that's no fun
<Hadaka>	happened with my laptop too - then I changed the driver
<Hadaka>	and managed to get one directory of unremovable junk on the disk
<Hadaka>	though I suppose that's fixable with reformatting - can you do that in linux or do you have to use windows for that?
<--	XpDuDe has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
<Zagor>	you can do that in linux
<Zagor>	it's just like any other scsi device
<Hadaka>	I remember seeing some weird FAT restoration utility way back - that's not necessary then these days or?
<Zagor>	umm, well I don't have it anyway :)
<Hadaka>	you've don mkfs.vfat on the archos from linux?
<Zagor>	yup
<Hadaka>	oh goodie, then I dare to try

<Jigsta>	Hi Linus
<Bagder>	heh, that auto build worked crap on the first automatic run ;-)
<Zagor>	hehe
<--	elinenbe has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
<Jigsta>	Just stumbeled accross your sourceforge page, sounds like a nice project
<Zagor>	well, we like it :)
<Bagder>	a nice project it is
<Jigsta>	:o)

<Zagor>	the yoda talk, bagder does
*	Bagder chuckles
<--	green_ has quit ("Client Exiting")
<jedix>	so, what is the firmware coded in?
<Linus>	C
<jedix>	really? I was expecting some sort of assembly
<Zagor>	some assembly required :)
<jedix>	why type of assembly?
<Zagor>	sh-1
<Zagor>	for the startup code, setting vector table, stack pointer and such things
<Bagder>	and the thread switch
<Zagor>	yes
<jedix>	oh, I haven't done any sh-1
<Bagder>	a perfect opportunity! ;-)
<Zagor>	you don't need it. all application code is C
<jedix>	I have C expierence.. but who doesn't ;)
<Hadaka>	is the hd access blocking right now btw?
<jedix>	what fs is the hdd?
<Zagor>	Hadaka: yes
<Zagor>	jedix: fat32
<Bagder>	plain old silly fat32
<Hadaka>	hm, the main annoyance in the UI is the blocking operations (the archos firmware ui that is)
<Zagor>	it's rather adequate for this kind of use, though
<Zagor>	Hadaka: yeah, but we've got threading. so blocking I/O is not a real problem
<Hadaka>	Zagor: but don't the threads have to yield? or do they do that in the I/O code?
<Linus>	the I/O code yields
<Zagor>	yup
<Hadaka>	so other threads run while the hd spins up? goooodie
<Zagor>	yep
<Linus>	one of our goals is to make our firmware more "snappy" than the original
*	Bagder spots Linus' last-mp3-byte fix ;-)
<Zagor>	funny noone complained about that :)
<Bagder>	haha
<Bagder>	yeah
<jedix>	snappy?
<Bagder>	don't everyone spend hours and hours running our software and listen carefully at the ends of songs? ;-)
<Zagor>	jedix: responsive
<Jigsta>	Hmm. Off to have a play :) cheers guys.
<--	Jigsta (~Mark@host217-39-163-123.in-addr.btopenworld.com) has left #rockbox
<jedix>	last-mp3-byte fix?
<Linus>	It could truncate the last byte of a sing
<Bagder>	we have a cvs-commit mailing list
<Linus>	song
<Linus>	if the length was odd
<Bagder>	gotta run, see ya
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
<Hadaka>	how much does the recorder 20 have ram? 1mb?
<Zagor>	2MB
<Linus>	2mb
<Linus>	All devices have the same amount
<Hadaka>	hm, that machine seems like quite nice to code for
<Zagor>	yeah, it's not bad
<Linus>	fun indeed
<Hadaka>	especially with the gdb on serial :P
<jedix>	what type of mp3 does it support?
<Zagor>	all types
<jedix>	320kbps? vbr?
<Linus>	that one was also fun to code
<Linus>	jedix: yes
<jedix>	cool
<Hadaka>	Ooo, RTC
<Zagor>	yeps
<Linus>	we don't have any drivers for it yet though
<jedix>	what does the player origionally support?
<Linus>	jedix: you mean bitrates and such?
<jedix>	yeah
<Linus>	the same
<Hadaka>	now all we need is a rocking microkernel :P
<Zagor>	although people keep saying it skips on high bitrates
<Linus>	jedix: but some people say that the original firmware has troubla playing 320kbps
<jedix>	some guy on /. said that it only supports the common bitrates
<Zagor>	never trust /. :)
<Zagor>	I have personally tested Rockbox with 256 and 320 kbit
<Hadaka>	hm, there probably is nothing in the style of an MMU is there?
<Zagor>	no
<Linus>	Gotta go now! CU guys!
<Hadaka>	oh well, one can't have everything
<--	Linus (~linus@labb.contactor.se) has left #rockbox
<Zagor>	we don't really need it
<jedix>	!? no recorder support
<Zagor>	not in 1.0, no
<Hadaka>	well true - but a microkernel could use it for memory protection - and swapping is easier to achieve too
<Zagor>	we haven't finished all drivers for recorder yet
<jedix>	how long until then?
<jedix>	42?
<Zagor>	hard to say. a few weeks perhaps. we don't know exactly why it doesn't work.
