<p>We often hang out on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/rockbox">#rockbox</a>
over at irc.freenode.net (freenode was once known as openprojects.net, see
<a href="http://freenode.net/">their web site</a> for more information).
Since there is a great deal of technical discussion, we log these sessions
for later reference.

<p>If you don't want to download and install an IRC client or are locked behind a firewall, try our <a href="cgiirc/irc.cgi">web client</a>.
