#define _PAGE_ Disassembling the Archos
#include "head.t"

<p>There are several ways to disassemble the Archos Jukeboxes.
Here is an approach where you don't need to bend any metal parts.

<p>You need a Torx 10 screwdriver and a very small (~2mm) philips head screwdriver.

First, remove the battery covers and unscrew all 8 visible screws: 2 torx screws on the left and right sides, and 2 philips head screws on the top and bottom. Then you simply lift off the plastic top cover.

Use your thumb nails to compress the thin edge of the rubber while gently pulling the metal plate over it.

Do the same on the side.

You have now freed one end of the Archos.
Now lift the blue rubber bumbers up from the circuit board on the other end, and simply slide the Archos out of its back plate.
