\chapter{\label{ref:album_art}Album Art}
Rockbox allows you to put the album art, or another image related to the music
on your \dap{} to display it in the PictureFlow plugin\opt{albumart}{ or in the
theme}. For this feature to work, there are a few requirements.

\section{Limitations}

\opt{albumart}{%
   Rockbox supports embedded album art only for some specific formats, see
  \reference{ref:featureset_for_generic_metadata_tags} for full details. It additionally
  supports loading images located on the \disk{}. PictureFlow is currently unable to
  use embedded album art.
}%
\nopt{albumart}{%
   Rockbox currently only supports loading images located on the
   \disk{} for use in PictureFlow.
}%
The image files must be in either BMP or JPEG format\opt{albumart}{, while embedded
album art is currently limited to JPEG.  Embedded JPEG images must not be
unsynchronized}. Rockbox does not support RLE-compressed BMP files, nor does it
support progressive and multi-scan JPEG files.
JPEG files must consist of a single scan with interleaved components, 
as progessive and multi-scan images require much more memory to decode.

\section{Where to put album art}

The pictures can be named a number of different ways, and placed to a number of
different locations. You can have pictures specific to the file or the album
or use a generic picture. You can place the picture in the same directory
as the file, in the parent directory or in a fixed directory named
\fname{/.rockbox/albumart/}. The order Rockbox uses when looking for a picture
is as follows (a list in braces means that those file extensions are tried in
that order):

\begin{enumerate}
\item  embedded (JPEG images in ID3v2 or MP4 tags only)
\item  \fname{./filename.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./cover.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./folder.jpg}
\item  \fname{/.rockbox/albumart/albumartist-albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{../albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{../cover.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\end{enumerate}

The following characters will be replaced with an underscore (\_) when looking
for albumtitle.bmp or albumartist-albumtitle.bmp: \textbackslash{} / : <
> ? * |. Doublequotes will be replaced by single quotes.
If no album artist is set, artist will be used instead. See \wikilink{AlbumArt}
in the wiki for programs that will help you automate the process of putting
album art on your \dap{}.
