\chapter{\label{ref:album_art}Album Art}
\section{Introduction}

Rockbox allows you to put the album art, or another image related to the music
on your \dap to display it in the PictureFlow plugin\opt{albumart}{ or in the
WPS}. For this feature to work, you must observe a few rules.

\section{Limitations}

Rockbox does not support album art embedded in your files' tags, and will
instead look for a picture located in the filesystem. In addition to this, the
pictures must be in the BMP format.

\section{Where to put album art}

The pictures can be named a number of different ways, and placed a number of
different locations. You can have pictures specific to the file or the album
or use a generic picture. You can place the picture in the same direcotry
as the file, in the parent directory or in a fixed directory named
\fname{/.rockbox/albumart/}. The order Rockbox uses when looking for a picture
is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \fname{./filename.bmp}
\item  \fname{./albumtitle.bmp}
\item  \fname{./cover.bmp}
\item  \fname{/.rockbox/albumart/artist-albumtitle.bmp}
\item  \fname{../albumtitle.bmp}
\item  \fname{../cover.bmp}
\end{enumerate}

The following characters will be replaced with an underscore (\_) when looking
for albumtitle.bmp or artist-albumtitle.bmp: \textbackslash{} / : \textless{}
\textgreater{} ? * \textbar{}. Doublequotes will be replaced by single qutoes.
See \wikilink{AlbumArt} in the wiki for more details and programs that will
help you automate the process of putting album art on your \dap{}.
