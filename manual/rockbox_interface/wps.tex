\section{\label{ref:WPS}While Playing Screen}
The While Playing Screen (WPS) displays various pieces of information about the
currently playing audio file.
%
The appearance of the WPS can be configured using WPS configuration files.
The items shown depend on your configuration -- all items can be turned on
or off independently. Refer to \reference{ref:wps_tags} for details on how
to change the display of the WPS.
\begin{itemize}
\item Status bar: The Status bar shows Battery level, charger status,
  volume, play mode, repeat mode, shuffle mode\opt{rtc}{ and clock}.
  In contrast to all other items, the status bar is always at the top of
  the screen.
\item (Scrolling) path and filename of the current song.
\item The ID3 track name.
\item The ID3 album name.
\item The ID3 artist name.
\item Bit rate. VBR files display average bitrate and ``(avg)''
\item Elapsed and total time.
\item A slidebar progress meter representing where in the song you are.
\item Peak meter.
\end{itemize}
%

See \reference{ref:ConfiguringtheWPS} for details of customising
your WPS (While Playing Screen).

\subsection{\label{ref:peak_meter}Peak Meter}
The peak meter can be displayed on the While Playing Screen and consists of
several indicators.
\opt{recording}{
  For a picture of the peak meter, please see the While
  Recording Screen in \reference{ref:while_recording_screen}.
}
\opt{ipodvideo}{
  \note{Especially the \playerman{} \playertype{}'s performance and battery runtime
   suffers when this feature is enabled. For this \dap{} it is highly recommended
   to not use peak meter.}
}

\begin{description}
\item [The bar:]
  This is the wide horizontal bar. It represents the current volume value.
\item [The peak indicator:]
  This is a little vertical line at the right end of the bar. It indicates
  the peak volume value that occurred recently.
\item [The clip indicator:]
  This is a little black block that is displayed at the very right of the
  scale when an overflow occurs. It usually does not show up during normal
  playback unless you play an audio file that is distorted heavily.
  \opt{recording}{
    If you encounter clipping while recording, your recording will sound distorted.
    You should lower the gain.
  }
  \note{Note that the clip detection is not very precise.
   Clipping might occur without being indicated.}
\item [The scale:]
  Between the indicators of the right and left channel there are little dots.
  These dots represent important volume values. In linear mode each dot is a
  10\% mark. In dBFS mode the dots represent the following values (from right
  to left): 0~dB, {}-3~dB, {}-6~dB, {}-9~dB, {}-12~dB, {}-18~dB, {}-24~dB, {}-30~dB,
  {}-40~dB, {}-50~dB, {}-60~dB.
\end{description}

\subsection{\label{sec:contextmenu}The WPS Context Menu}
Like the context menu for the \setting{File Browser}, the \setting{WPS Context Menu}
allows you quick access to some often used functions.

\subsubsection{Playlist}
The \setting{Playlist} submenu allows you to view, save, search, reshuffle,
and display the play time of the current playlist. These and other operations
are detailed in \reference{ref:working_with_playlists}. To change settings for
the \setting{Playlist Viewer} press \ActionStdContext{} while viewing the
current playlist to bring up the \setting{Playlist Viewer Menu}. In this
menu, you can find the \setting{Playlist Viewer Settings}.

\paragraph{Playlist Viewer Settings}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Show Icons.] This toggles display of the icon for the currently
    selected playlist entry and the icon for moving a playlist entry
    \item[Show Indices.] This toggles display of the line numbering for
       the playlist
    \item[Track Display.] This toggles between filename only and full path
       for playlist entries
  \end{description}


\subsubsection{Playlist catalogue}
  \begin{description}
    \item [View catalogue.] This lists all playlists that are part of the
    Playlist catalogue. You can load a new playlist directly from this list.
    \item [Add to playlist.] Adds the currently playing file to a playlist.
    Select the playlist you want the file to be added to and it will get
    appended to that playlist.
    \item [Add to new playlist.] Similar to the previous entry this will
    add the currently playing track to a playlist. You need to enter a name
    for the new playlist first.
  \end{description}

\subsubsection{Sound Settings}
This is a shortcut to the \setting{Sound Settings Menu}, where you can configure volume,
bass, treble, and other settings affecting the sound of your music.
See \reference{ref:configure_rockbox_sound} for more information.

\subsubsection{Playback Settings}
This is a shortcut to the \setting{Playback Settings Menu}, where you can configure shuffle,
repeat, party mode, skip length and other settings affecting the playback of your music.

\subsubsection{Rating}
The menu entry is only shown if \setting{Gather Runtime Information} is
enabled. It allows the assignment of a personal rating value (0 -- 10)
to a track which can be displayed in the WPS and used in the Database
browser. The value wraps at 10.

\subsubsection{Bookmarks}
This allows you to create a bookmark in the currently-playing track.

\subsubsection{\label{ref:trackinfoviewer}Show Track Info}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-id3-viewer}{The track info viewer}{}
This screen is accessible from the WPS screen, and provides a detailed view of
all the identity information about the current track. This info is known as
meta data and is stored in audio file formats to keep information on artist,
album etc. To access this screen, %
\opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD,IRIVER_H300_PAD,IRIVER_H10_PAD,%
      SANSA_C200_PAD,SANSA_E200_PAD,SANSA_FUZE_PAD,SANSA_FUZEPLUS_PAD}{
  press \ActionWpsIdThreeScreen. }%
\opt{IPOD_4G_PAD,IPOD_3G_PAD,IAUDIO_X5_PAD,IAUDIO_M3_PAD,%
      GIGABEAT_PAD,GIGABEAT_S_PAD,MROBE100_PAD,SANSA_CLIP_PAD,PBELL_VIBE500_PAD,%
      MPIO_HD200_PAD,MPIO_HD300_PAD,SAMSUNG_YH92X_PAD,SAMSUNG_YH820_PAD,XDUOO_X3_PAD}%
      {press \ActionWpsContext{} to access the
      \setting{WPS Context Menu} and select \setting{Show Track Info}. }

\subsubsection{Open With...}
This \setting{Open With} function is the same as the \setting{Open With}
function in the file browser's \setting{Context Menu}.

\subsubsection{Delete}
Delete the currently playing file. The file will be deleted but the playback
of the file will not stop immediately. Instead, the part of the file that
has already been buffered (i.e. read into the \daps\ memory) will be played.
This may even be the whole track.

\opt{pitchscreen}{
  \subsubsection{\label{sec:pitchscreen}Pitch}

  The \setting{Pitch Screen} allows you to change the rate of playback
  (i.e. the playback speed and at the same time the pitch) of your
  \dap.  The rate value can be adjusted
  between 50\% and 200\%. 50\% means half the normal playback speed and a
  pitch that is an octave lower than the normal pitch. 200\% means double
  playback speed and a pitch that is an octave higher than the normal pitch.

  The rate can be changed in two modes: procentual and semitone.
  Initially, procentual mode is active.

    If you've enabled the \setting{Timestretch} option in
    \setting{Sound Settings} and have since rebooted, you can also use
    timestretch mode. This allows you to change the playback speed
    without affecting the pitch, and vice versa.

    In timestretch mode there are separate displays for pitch and
    speed, and each can be altered independently.  Due to the
    limitations of the algorithm, speed is limited to be between 35\%
    and 250\% of the current pitch value.  Pitch must maintain the
    same ratio as well as remain between 50\% and 200\%.

  The value of the rate, pitch and speed
  is not persistent, i.e. after the \dap\ is turned on it will
  always be set to 100\%.  However, the rate, pitch and speed
  information will be stored in any bookmarks you may create
  (see \reference{ref:Bookmarkconfigactual}) and will be restored upon
  playing back those bookmarks.

  \begin{btnmap}
