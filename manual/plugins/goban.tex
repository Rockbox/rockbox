\screenshot{plugins/images/ss-goban}{Goban}{The Rockbox Goban plugin}
Goban is a a plugin for playing, viewing and recording games of Go (also known
as Weiqi, Baduk, Igo and Goe).  It uses standard Smart Game Format (SGF) files
for saving and loading games.

You can find a short introduction to Go at
\url{http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo} and more information about SGF files
can be read at \url{http://senseis.xmp.net/?SmartGameFormat} or the SGF
specification at
\url{http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/}.

This plugin can load all modern SGF files (file format 3 or 4) with few problems.
It attempts to preserve SGF properties which it doesn't understand, and most common
SGF properties are handled fully.  It is possible to view (and edit if you like)
Kogo's Joseki Dictionary (\url{http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm}) with this plugin,
although the load and save times can be on the order of a minute or two on
particularly slow devices.  Large SGF files may stop audio playback for the duration
of the plugin's run in order to free up more memory and some very large SGF files will
not even load on devices with little available memory.

\emph{Note: } The plugin does \emph{NOT} support SGF files with multiple games in
one file.  These are rare, but if you have one don't even try it (the file will most
likely be corrupted if you save over it).  You have been warned.

The file \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} is used by the plugin to store any unsaved
changes in the most recently loaded game.  This means that if you forget to save your
changes, you should load \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} immediately to offload the changes
to another file.  If you load another file first then your changes will be lost
permanently.  The \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} file is also the file loaded if another
is not selected.

The information panel which displays the current move number may also contain
these markers: \\
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}\toprule
\textbf{Mark} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \midrule
    \emph{+ } & There are nodes after the current node in the SGF tree. \\

\subsection{Menus}
\begin {description}
\item [Main Menu. ]
    The main menu for game setup and access to other menus.

    \emph {New. } Create a new game with your choice of board size and handicaps. \\
    \emph {Save. } Save the current state of the game.  It will be saved to
    \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} unless otherwise set. \\
    \emph {Save As. } Save to a specified file. \\
    \emph {Game Info. } View and modify the metadata of the current game. \\
    \emph {Playback Control. } Control the playback of the current playlist and
    modify the volume of your player. \\
    \emph {Zoom Level. } Zoom in or out on the board.  If you set the zoom level, it
    will be saved and used again the next time you open this plugin. \\
    \emph {Options. } Open the Options Menu. \\
    \emph {Context Menu. } Open the Context Menu which allows you to set play modes
    and other tools. \\
    \emph {Quit. } Leave the plugin.  Any unsaved changes are saved to
    \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"}. \\

\item [Game Info. ]
    The menu for modifying game info (metadata) of the current game.  This
    information will be saved to the SGF file and can be viewed in almost all
    SGF readers.

    \emph {Basic Info. } Shows a quick view of the basic game metadata, if any
    has been set (otherwise does nothing).  This option does not allow editing. \\
    \emph {Time Limit. } The time limit of the current game. \\
    \emph {Overtime. } The overtime settings of the current game. \\
    \emph {Result. } The result of the current game.  This text must follow the
    format specified at \url{http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/properties.html#RE} to
    be read by other SGF readers.  Some examples are \emph {B+R} (Black wins by
    resignation), \emph {B+5.5} (Black wins by 5.5 points), \emph {W+T} (White wins
    on Time). \\
    \emph {Handicap. } The handicap of the current game. \\
    \emph {Komi. } The komi of the current game (compensation to the white
    player for black having the first move). \\
    \emph {Ruleset. } The name of the ruleset in use for this game.  The \emph{NZ}
    and \emph{GOE} rulesets include suicide as a legal move (for multi-stone
    suicide only); the rest do not. \\
    \emph {Black Player. } The name of the black player. \\
    \emph {Black Rank. } Black's rank, in dan or kyu. \\
    \emph {Black Team. } The name of black's team, if any. \\
    \emph {White Player. } The name of the white player. \\
    \emph {White Rank. }  White's rank, in dan or kyu. \\
    \emph {White Team. } The name of white's team, if any. \\
    \emph {Date. } The date that this game took place.  This text must follow the
    format specified at \url{http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/properties.html#DT} to
    be read by other SGF readers. \\
    \emph {Event. } The name of the event which this game was a part of, if any.
    \\
    \emph {Place. } The place that this game took place. \\
    \emph {Round. } If part of a tournament, the round number for this game. \\
    \emph {Done. } Return to the previous menu. \\

\item [Options. ]
    Customize the behavior of the plugin in certain ways.

    \emph {Show Child Variations? } Enable this to mark child variations on the board
    if there are more than one.  Note: variations which don't start with a move are
    not visible in this way. \\
    \emph {Disable Idle Poweroff? } Enable this if you do not want the \dap{} to turn
    off after a certain period of inactivity (depends on your global Rockbox
    settings). \\
    \emph {Idle Autosave Time. } Set the amount of idle time to wait before
    automatically saving any unsaved changes.  These autosaves go to the file
    \fname {"/sgf/gbn\_def.sgf"} regardless of if you have loaded a game or used
    \emph {Save As} to save the game before or not.  Set to \emph {Off} to disable
    this functionality completely. \\
    \emph {Automatically Show Comments? } If this is enabled and you navigate to a
    node containing game comments, they will automatically be displayed. \\

\item [Context Menu. ]
    The menu for choosing different play modes and tools, adding or editing
    comments, adding pass moves, or switching between sibling variations.

    \emph {Play Mode. } Play moves normally on the board.  If there are
    child moves from the current node, this mode will let you follow variations
    by simply playing the first move in the sequence.  Unless it is following a
    variation, this mode will not allow you to play illegal moves.  This is the
    default mode before another is set after loading a game or creating a new
    one. \\
    \emph {Add Black Mode. } Add black stones to the board as desired. These
    stones are not moves and do not perform captures or count as ko threats. \\
    \emph {Add White Mode. } Add white stones to the board as desired. These
    stones are not moves and do not perform captures or count as ko threats. \\
    \emph {Erase Stone Mode. } Remove stones from the board as desired.  These
    removed stones are not counted as captured, they are simply removed. \\
    \emph {Pass. } Play a single pass move.  This does not change the mode of
    play. \\
    \emph {Next Variation. } If the game is at the first move in a variation,
    this will navigate to the next variation after the current one.  This is
    the only way to reach variations which start with adding or removing
    stones, as you cannot follow them by "playing" the same move. \\
    \emph {Force Play Mode. } The same as Play Mode except that this mode will
    allow you to play illegal moves such as retaking a ko immediately without a
    ko threat, suicide on rulesets which don't allow it (including single stone
    suicide), and playing a move where there is already a stone. \\
    \emph {Mark Mode. } Add generic marks to the board, or remove them. \\
    \emph {Circle Mode. } Add circle marks to the board, or remove them. \\
    \emph {Square Mode. } Add square marks to the board, or remove them. \\
    \emph {Triangle Mode. } Add triangle marks to the board, or remove them. \\
    \emph {Label Mode. } Add one character labels to the board.  Each label
    starts at the letter 'a' and each subsequent application of a label will
    increment the letter.  To remove a label, click on it until it cycles
    through the allowed letters and disappears. \\
    \emph {Add/Edit Comment. } Add or edit a comment at the current node. \\
    \emph {Done. } Go back to the previous screen. \\
