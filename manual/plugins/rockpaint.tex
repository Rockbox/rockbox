Rockpaint is a bitmap (\fname{.bmp}) editor for Rockbox. It can open any \fname{.bmp} file
whose dimensions are the same size as your device's screen or smaller; it can
also create empty bitmaps for you to work with.\\

\subsubsection{Opening A File}
To open a file, you may use either the context menu option ``Open With'' in the
File Browser, or you may enter Rockpaint first using the Plugins menu and open
a file from there. To perform the latter, simply press Rockpaint's Menu button
or move the cursor beyond the bottom of the screen; then move the cursor onto
``Menu'' and select it. Finally, select ``Load'' and navigate to the image you
wish to open.\\

\subsubsection{Tools}
Rockpaint offers several tools to aid you in editing; you can view them by
either pressing Rockpaint's ``Menu'' key or by attempting to move the cursor
beyond the bottom of the screen. From top to bottom and left to right, and
by section, they are as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item[Colour Picker]
        The top left tool shows your colours that are at the ready. To
        swap them, ``click'' on the background colour. To edit the foreground colour,
        click on it.
    \item[Preset Pallete]
        Several preset colours are availible. Clicking on one changes
        the foreground of the Colour Picker to the selected colour.
    \item[Pencil]
        Draws as you move the cursor. You can change the brush size with the
        Menu option ``Brush Size''. Use the Select key to toggle the tool while editing
        the image.
    \item[Selection tool]
        Allows you to select a rectangular region; once you do, you
        will be shown a menu of options (including ``cancel'' if you make a mistake).
    \item[Line tool]
        Draws a straight line.
    \item[Curve tool]
        Allows you to draw a line and curve it.
    \item[Rectangle tool]
        Draws an unfilled rectangle.
    \item[Circle tool]
        Draws an unfilled circle.
    \item[Gradient fill]
        To use this tool, click at the starting and ending points.
        Starting with the background and going to the foreground colour, Rockpaint
        will fill the region with a gradual colour change.
    \item[Bucket fill]
        Fills an same-colour or empty region with a colour.
    \item[Dropper]
        Click on a colour in the image to change the foreground colour to it.
    \item[Eraser]
        The opposite of the pencil; it changes painted pixels to white.
    \item[Text tool]
        ``Draws'' text on the image.
    \item[Filled rectangle]
        Same as the Rectangle tool, but fills it with colour.
    \item[Filled circle]
        Same as the Circle tool, but fills it with colour.
    \item[Curved Gradient Fill]
        Same as Gradient fill, but you must draw two lines.
        Rockpaint will draw a curved, gradual change of colour in the region.
    \item[Menu]
        This opens the Main Menu. You can also press the Menu key to open it.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Main Menu}
The main menu consists of the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Resume]
        Closes the Main Menu.
    \item[New]
        Creates a new canvas and discards the current file. BE CAREFUL.
        You will lose any unsaved changes in the file that is currently open.
    \item[Load]
        Loads a bitmap file. Simply navigate to the file as you
        would in the file browser.
    \item[Save]
        Saves the current file. If it has not been saved before,
        you will be given a chance to name it and choose the saving location.
    \item[Set Width]
        Allows you to change the width of the image.
        Border to indicate the width will be shown but it doesn't affect drawing.
    \item[Set Height]
        Allows you to change the height of the image.
        Border to indicate the height will be shown but it doesn't affect drawing.
    \item[Brush speed]
        Changes the speed at which the selection cursor
        moves when you hold down a movement button.
    \item[Brush size]
        Allows you to adjust the drawing size of the pencil tool.
    \item[Choose colour]
        Allows you to manually edit the foreground colour.
        You can edit the RBG and/or the HSV values.
    \item[Grid size]
        Allows you to show or hide a grid over the canvas,
        and to specify its size.
    \item[Exit]
        Exits Rockpaint.
\end{description}

\warn{BE CAREFUL. Rockpaint will NOT prompt you to save
if you select Exit, so any unsaved changes will be lost.}
