\subsection{Random Folder Advance Configuration}
{\label{ref:random_folder_advance_config}}
This plugin is used to configure the folders which will be considered
when the Auto-Change Directory feature is set to \setting{Random}.

\subsubsection{Menu}
\begin{description}
\item[Generate Folder List] Generates a list of all folders found 
on the player.  You can filter the directories which are scanned by
creating a file called \\* 
\fname{/.rockbox/folder\_advance\_dir.txt}.  
Only the directories in this file and any contained directories
 will be scanned.  You can have up to 10 directories ignored by the 
 scan by placing a minus sign before them in the list 
 (i.e. \fname{-/CDs} will cause everything in the \fname{/CDs} 
 directory to be ignored.).  If you just want \fname{/CDs}
 to be ignored but want to include the folders within 
it you need to have both \fname{-/CDs} and \fname{CDs} as entries.
\item[Edit Folder List] Enter the folder list editor
\item[Export List To Textfile] Exports the list to 
  \fname{/.rockbox/folder\_advance\_list.txt}
\item[Import List From Textfile] Imports the list from
  \fname{/.rockbox/folder\_advance\_list.txt}
\item[Quit]
