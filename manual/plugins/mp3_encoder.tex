\subsection{MP3 Encoder}
This plugin allows to encode a \fname{.wav} file to MP3 format. Supported input 
format is uncompressed, linear PCM with 16 bit per sample and maximum 2 channels. 
Allowed sample rates are 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1 and 48~kHz.
The user will be asked to select the desired output bitrate of the compressed
MP3 file. 

\begin{description}
\item[Select Bitrate] The following bitrates can be selected: 64, 80, 96, 112, 
128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320~kbps.

Remark: Bitrates above 160~kbps cannot be used in MPEG~2 Layer~3 bitstreams. 
The encoder plugin automatically limits the output bitrate to 160~kbps for 
input files with a sample rate of 16, 22.05 or 24~kHz. The same limitation is 
valid for mono files.
\end{description}

The output \fname{.mp3} file is written to the same path as the \fname{.wav} 
file using the same filename. To use this plugin, open the \setting{Context Menu} 
(see \reference{ref:Contextmenu}) upon a \fname{.wav} file and select 
\setting{Open With\dots $\rightarrow$ mp3\_encoder}.

\note{
The encoder will choose the appropriate bitstream format from the sample rate
of the input file. Output bitstream format is MPEG~1 Layer~3 for 32, 44.1 and 
48~kHz, and MPEG~2 Layer~3 for 16, 22.05 and 24~kHz. MPEG~2.5 Layer~3 is not 
supported.
