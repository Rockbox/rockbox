Jewels is a simple yet addicting game which involves swapping 
pairs of jewels in order to form connected segments of three 
or more of the same type.

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible 
before running out of available moves. Higher points are 
awarded to larger combos. The game advances to the next level 
after every one hundred points and randomly clears several jewels.
