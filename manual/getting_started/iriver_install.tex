\subsection{Installing the bootloader}
  Installing the bootloader is the trickiest part of the installation.
  The Rockbox bootloader allows users to boot into either the Rockbox 
  firmware or the iriver firmware. For legal reasons, we cannot distribute 
  the bootloader. Instead, we have developed a program that will patch the 
  Iriver firmware with the Rockbox bootloader. These instructions will explain 
  how to download and patch the Iriver firmware with the Rockbox bootloader 
  and install it on your jukebox.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download a supported version of the Iriver firmware for your \playername\ from 
	the Iriver website or from 
	\url{http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/ManualRockboxInstall}.
	Supported	Iriver firmware versions currently include 
		\opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD}{1.63US, 1.63EU, 1.63K, 1.65US, 1.65EU, 1.65K, 1.66US, 1.66EU 
		and 1.66K.  Note that the H140 uses the same firmware as the H120; H120 and H140 owners should use the
			firmware called \fname{ihp\_120.hex}.  Likewise, the iHP110 and iHP115 use the same 
			firmware,	called \fname{ihp\_100.hex}.   Be sure to use the correct firmware file
			for your player.
		}
		\opt{IRIVER_H300_PAD}{1.28K, 1.28EU, 1.28J, 1.29K, 1.29J and 1.30EU.\\
			\note{The US H3xx firmware is not currently supported and cannot be patched to be 
			used with the bootloader. If you wish to install Rockbox on a US \playername\, you 
			must use an international firmware, which will permanently remove DRM support from 
			the player.}
		}
		If the file that you downloaded is a \fname{.zip} file, use an unzip 
		utility such as \fname{InfoZip}, \fname{7zip}, \fname{WinRAR},	or 
		\fname{WinZip} to extract the \fname{.hex} from the \fname{.zip} file
		to your desktop. Likewise, if the file that you downloaded is an 
		\fname{.exe} file, double-click on the \fname{.exe}	file to extract 
		the \fname{.hex} file to your desktop.
		
	\item Download the firmware patcher \fname{fwpatcher.exe} from the site 
	listed in the prior step and save it to your desktop.

 	\warn{The firmware patcher contains Unicode support, which is not supported by 
	all versions of Windows. If you have difficulty with the firmware patcher, try 
	downloading the alternate firmware patcher \fname{fwpatchernu.exe}, which is 
	built without Unicode support.}

  \item Go to your desktop and double-click on whichever version of the firmware 
  patcher you downloaded in the prior step.
  
  \item In the firmware patcher dialog box, click on the BROWSE button and navigate
  to the \fname{.hex} file that you previously downloaded to your desktop.
  	
  \item Click PATCH. The firmware patcher will patch the original firmware to 
  include the Rockbox bootloader. The \fname{.hex} file on your desktop is now
  a modified version of the original \fname{.hex} file.
  
  \item Turn on your \playername\ and connect it to your computer via USB.
  
	\item Copy or move the modified \fname{.hex} file to the ROOT directory of 
	your jukebox.

  \item Disconnect the jukebox from USB. (Be sure to use Windows' ``safely remove
  hardware'' option.)

	\warn{Before proceeding further, make sure that your player has a full charge, 
	or that it is connected to the power adaptor.}

	\item Update your \playername s firmware with the patched bootloader. To do this, turn 
	the jukebox on. Press and hold the 
	\opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD}{\ButtonSelect\ button }
	\opt{IRIVER_H300_PAD}{\ButtonSelect button }
	 to enter the main menu, and navigate to \setting{General} --> \setting{Firmware 
	 Upgrade}. Select \setting{Yes} when asked to confirm if you want to upgrade the 
	 firmware. The \playername\ will display a message indicating that the firmware update 
	 is in progress. Do not interrupt this process. When the firmware update is 
	 complete, the player will turn itself off. (The update firmware process usually 
	 takes a minute or so.)

You have now installed the Rockbox bootloader. 

\opt{H1xx}{\note{If you install the Rockbox bootloader, but do not install the
Rockbox firmware, the Rockbox bootloader will load the iriver firmware when the
jukebox is turned on.}}
