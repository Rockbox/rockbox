Build Your Own Rockbox

1. Check out 'rockbox' from CVS (or extract a downloaded archive). You
   want to check out 'rockbox-devel' instead if you want the simulator
   code too (for trying out things on host before making target tests).

   (For more information about the simulator, read UISIMULATOR.)

   $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@www.rockbox.org:/cvsroot/rockbox login 
   $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@www.rockbox.org:/cvsroot/rockbox co rockbox

     or

   $ tar xzf rockbox.tar.gz

2. Create a build directory, preferably in the same directory as the firmware/
   and apps/ directories. This is where all generated files will be written.

   $ cd rockbox
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build

4. In your build directory, run the 'tools/configure' script and enter what
   target you want to build for and if you want a debug version or not (and a
   few more questions). It'll prompt you. The debug version is for making a
   gdb version out of it. It is only useful if you run gdb towards your target
   Archos.

   $ ../tools/configure

5. *ploink*. Now you have got a Makefile generated for you.

6. Make sure you have sh-elf-gcc and siblings in the PATH. Make sure that you
   have 'perl' in your PATH too.

   $ which sh-elf-gcc
   $ which perl

7. Run 'make' and soon the necessary pieces from the firmware and the apps
   directories have been compiled, linked and scrambled for you.

   $ make

8. Copy the archos.mod or ajbrec.ajz file to your archos, reboot it and
   *smile*.  Recent Rockbox versions need no reboots, just PLAY a new rockbox
   version and that'll be loaded and replace the currently running version.

   $ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/archos
   $ cp ajbrec.ajz /mnt/archos
   $ umount /mnt/archos

Whenever the tools/configure script gets updated, you can make your makefile
updated too by running 'tools/configure update'.

If you want to build for more than one target, just create several build
directories and create a setup for each target:

   $ mkdir build-fmrecorder
   $ cd build-fmrecorder
   $ ../tools/configure

   $ mkdir build-player
   $ cd build-player
   $ ../tools/configure
