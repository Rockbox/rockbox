Rockbox History

* Dec 2001

  Björn Stenberg set up and announced the mailing list for Archos Open Source
  Jukebox software hacking dicsussions. People started to join up. The
  scrambling algorithm was "broken" and the first ever LED-flashing program
  was downloaded and run.

  Lots of efforts were put on researching the hardware, how it works, what
  circuits that are used, where to find the spec sheets for those circuits
  etc.

  By the end of the month, the first working LCD-code for the Recorder was
  written.

  148 mails was posted to the list.

* Jan 2002

  Initial source packages were offered that did basic things like scrolling
  or blinking on the screen.

  A vote page was setup for people to vote on a project name, and even while
  Rockbox was not the winning one, Björn showed his dictator-side and set the
  project name. Rockbox it shall be.

  Discussions about development environments.

  The issue of locked hard disks were discussed a lot, since Björn got this
  problem on a whole range of his disks!

  More hardware pins and functionality was detected and researched.

  At the end of the month, Rockbox was setup as a project on sourceforge.net
  and people immediately started posting feature-requests.

  187 mails was posted to the list.
