                            Plugin API summmary

Plugin API Version 26
(backwards compability up to version 25)

Info: To get the latest plugin api specs:
look at struct plugin_api in apps/plugin.h
(and apps/plugins/helloworld.c for an example)

Plugin Skeleton
===============

#include "plugin.h"

static struct plugin_api* rb;

//plugin entry point
enum plugin_status plugin_start(struct plugin_api* api, void* parameter)
{
    TEST_PLUGIN_API(api);
    (void)parameter;
    rb = api;
    
    //insert your code here
    
    return PLUGIN_OK;
}

to call a function, use the plugin_api structure this way :  rb->function()

Plugin Internals
================

  int version;

     Plugin version number.

  int plugin_test(int api_version, int model, int memsize);

     This function is called by the TEST_PLUGIN_API() macro to test
     compability of the plugin with current software.
     Returns PLUGIN_OK if plugin is supported.
     Returns PLUGIN_WRONG_API_VERSION if plugin version isn't compatible.
     Returns PLUGIN_WRONG_MODEL if the model or memsize is wrong.

LCD
===

  Generic
  -------

    Most LCD functions are specific for which output we work with, due to the
    huge differences.

      Display a formated string in a box durring time ticks. If center is
      FALSE, the display is left justified. If center is TRUE, the display
      is centered horizontaly and verticaly. The string is formated as with
      the printf function.
      (There are HZ ticks per second)
   
    void lcd_puts(int x, int y, const unsigned char *string);

       Rolls up the lcd display by the specified amount of lines.
       Lines that are rolled out over the top of the screen are rolled in
       from the bottom again. This is a hardware remapping only and all
       operations on the lcd are affected.
       The screen is rolled up of pixel lines. The value must be between
       0 and LCD_HEIGHT.
       [Not for simulator]

  Player

    void lcd_icon(int icon, bool enable);

       ??? (see firmware/drivers/lcd-player.c:463)


Buttons
=======

  These functions work the same regardless of which keypad you have, but they
  return a different set of values. Note that the Recorder keypad has 10
  keys, while the Player keypad only features 6.

  Possible return values can be found in the firmware/export/button.h file.

  int button_get(bool block);

     Returns a bitmask for which keys were pressed. If 'block' is set TRUE it
     won't return until a key is pressed.

  int button_get_w_tmo(int ticks);

     Wait for a key press for ticks ticks. (There are HZ ticks per second)
     Returns a bitmask for which keys were pressed. If no key was pressed,
     return BUTTON_NONE.

  int button_status(void);

     Returns a bitmask for which keys are currently pressed.

  void button_clear_queue(void);

     Empty the button queue.
  

Files
=====

  (These functions are POSIX look-alikes)

  int open(const char *pathname, int flags);

     The open() function establishes the connection between a file and a file
     descriptor. It creates an open file description that refers to a file
     and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file
     descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file.

  ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

     The read() function attempts to read count bytes from the file associated
     with the open file descriptor, fd, into the buffer pointed to by buf.

  off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);

     The lseek() function sets the file pointer associated with the open file
     descriptor specified by fd as follows:

        o  If whence is SEEK_SET, the pointer is set to offset bytes.

        o  If whence is SEEK_CUR,  the  pointer  is  set  to  its
           current location plus offset.

        o  If whence is SEEK_END, the pointer is set to the  size
           of the file plus offset.

  int creat(const char *pathname, mode_t mode)

     Create a file with mode O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR. Returns the
     file descriptor associated to this file.
 
  ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

     Write writes up to count bytes to the file referenced by the file
     descriptor fd from the buffer starting at buf.

  int close(int fd);

     The close() function will deallocate the file descriptor indicated by
     fd.  To deallocate means to make the file descriptor available for
     return by subsequent calls to open() or other functions that allocate
     file descriptors.
     Returns 0 upon success.

  int rename(const char *path, const char *newname);

     The rename() function changes the name of a file. The path argument
     points to the pathname of the file to be renamed. The newname argument
     points to the new pathname of the file.

  int remove(const char *pathname);

     remove() deletes a name from the filesystem.  It calls unlink for files,
     and rmdir for directories.

  int ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);

     Truncate file to the specified length.

  int filesize(int fd);

     Returns size of a file. Upon error, returns -1.

  int fdprintf(int fd, const char *fmt, ...);

     Write a formated string in the fd.
     Returns the number of characters writen to file.
     Returns a negative value upon error.

  int read_line(int fd, char* buffer, int buffer_size);

     Read (up to) a line of text from fd into buffer and return number of bytes
     read (which may be larger than the number of bytes stored in buffer). If 
     an error occurs, -1 is returned (and buffer contains whatever could be 
     read). A line is terminated by a LF char. Neither LF nor CR chars are 
     stored in buffer.    

  int settings_parseline(char* line, char** name, char** value);

     Parse a line from a configuration file. The line format is: 
     name: value
     Any whitespace before setting name or value (after ':') is ignored.
     A # as first non-whitespace character discards the whole line.
     Function sets pointers to null-terminated setting name and value.
     Returns false if no valid config entry was found

  int ata_sleep(void)
 
     Give the disk some rest.
     [Not for simulator]


Directories
===========

  DIR *opendir(const char *name);

     The opendir() function opens a directory stream corresponding to the
     directory name, and returns a pointer to the directory stream.  The
     stream is positioned at the first entry in the directory.

  struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dir);

     The readdir() function returns a pointer to a dirent structure
     representing the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed to
     by dir.  It returns NULL on reaching the end-of-file or if an error
     occurred.

     struct dirent {
         unsigned char d_name[MAX_PATH];
         int attribute;
         int size;
         int startcluster;
         unsigned short wrtdate; /*  Last write date */
         unsigned short wrttime; /*  Last write time */
     };

  int closedir(DIR *dir);

     The closedir() function closes the directory stream associated with dir.
     The directory stream descriptor dir is not available after this call.


Kernel
======

  void sleep(ticks);

     Sleep a specified number of ticks, we have HZ ticks per second.

  void yield(void);

     Let another thread run. This should be used as soon as you have to "wait"
     for something or similar, and also if you do anything that takes "a long
     time". This function is the entire foundation that our "cooperative
     multitasking" is based on. Use it.

  void usb_screen(void);

     Show the usb connection screen.
     
  long current_tick;

     The global tick variable.
     
  int default_event_handler(int event);

     If event == SYS_USB_CONNECTED, call usb_screen and return
     SYS_USB_CONNECTED. Else do nothing and return 0.
     
  int create_thread(void* function, void* stack, int stack_size,
                    const char *name);
 
     Create a thread.
     ??? (see firmware/thread.c:145)
     Return its ID if context area could be allocated, else return -1.
     
  void remove_thread(int threadnum);

     Remove a thread from the scheduler.
     Parameter is the ID as returned from create_thread().
     
  void reset_poweroff_timer(void);

     The function name pretty much says what it's supposed to do.


String/Memory
=============

  int strcmp(const char *a, const char *b);

     strcmp compares the string a to string b. If a sorts lexicographically
     after b, strcmp returns a number greater than zero. If the two strings
     match, strcmp returns zero. If a sorts lexicographically before b,
     strcmp returns a number less than zero.
     
  char *strcpy(char *dst, const char *src);

     strcpy copies the string pointed to by src (including the terminating
     null character) to the arra pointed to by dst.
     This function returns the initial value of dst.
     
  void *memcpy(void *out, const void *in, size_t length);

     Copies length bytes of data in memory from source to dest.
  
  void *memset(void *dst, int c, size_t length);

     Fills a memory region with specified byte value.
     
  int snprintf(char *buf, size_t size, const char *fmt, ...);

     Write a formated formated string in buffer buf of size size
     (including the trailing '\0').
     Upon success, return the number of characters printed or that would have
     been printed if the output was truncated (not including the trailing 
     '\0').
     These support %c, %s, %d and %x only with the width and zero padding
     flag only.
     
  char *strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t length);

     strncpy copies not more than length characters from the string pointed
     to by src (including the terminating null character) to the array pointed
     to by dst. If the string pointed to by src is shorter than length
     characters, null characters are apended to the destination array until
     a total of length characters have been written.
     This function returns the initial value of dst.
     
  size_t strlen(const char *str);

     The strlen function works out the length of the string starting at str
     by counting characters until it reaches a null character.
     strlen returns the character count.
     
  char *strrchr(const char *string, int c);

     This function finds the last occurence of c (converted to a char) in the
     string pointed to by string (including the terminating null character).
     Returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer if c
     does not occur in string.
     
  int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

     The  strcasecmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2, ignoring
     the case of the characters.  It returns an integer less than, equal to,
     or  greater than zero if s1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to
     match, or be greater than s2.
     
  int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

     Like strncasecmp() but only on the first n characters.
     {new in plugin API version 26}
     
  const char *_ctype_;
 
     ??? (see firmware/common/ctype.c)
     [Not for simulator]
     
  int atoi(const char *str);

     The atoi() function converts the initial portion of a string pointed
     to by str to int.

     describes the size of each element of the array.

     You must supply a pointer to a comparison function, using the 
     argument shown as compar. (This permits the sorting objects of
     unknown properties.) Define the comparison function to accept
     two arguments, each a pointer to an element of the array starting
     at base. The result of (*compar) must be negative if the first
     argument is less than the second, zero if the two arguments match,
     and positive if the first argument is greater than the second 
     (chere ``less than'' and ``greter than'' refer to whatever
     arbitrary ordering is appropriate).

     The arra is sorted in place; that is, when qsort returns, the array
     elements begining at base have been reordered.
