                               How to build the UISimulators

Terminology

  The hardware is mainly separated in two different versions. The "Player" is
  the Archos Jukebox Player 6000 and Archos Studio 20, while the "Recorder" is
  the Archos Recorder 20. The "Player" has a character-based LCD screen with 2
  lines of 11 letters and a big round thing on the keypad (featuring 6
  different keys), while the "Recorder" has a graphical LCD and has all its 10
  keys separate.

1. Get Sources

  The the very latest sources off the CVS server. Get the 'tools' dir,
  'firmware' dir, the 'apps' dir and the 'uisimulator' dir on the same dir
  level, to make it easier to build things (some of the files assume this
  hierarchy).

  All CVS details can be found here: http://rockbox.haxx.se/cvs.html

2. Build Uisimulator

  For the X11 simulator:

    (This has been compiled and run on at least Solaris and Linux. It should
    work on other unixes too but we haven't tried any other yet.)

    Create a new directory and run the 'tools/configure' script in
    there. Select target to simulate and select simulation. The script will
    then generate a Makefile for you:
 
        $ mkdir build-dir
        $ cd build-dir
        $ ../tools/configure

        [ answer to questions ]

        [ Makefile created, archos subdirectory created ]

        $ make
        $ make install
        $ ./rockboxui

    Note that the simulator uses a local subdirectory named 'archos' as "root
    directory" for the simulated box. Copy a bunch of mp3 files into that
    directory, create subdirectories and do all sorts of things you want to be
    able to browse when you fire up the simulator.


  For the Win32 simulator:

    No info yet.

3. Run Uisimulator

  To create a simulated disk drive for the simulator to see, create a
  subdirectory named 'archos' and populate it with a bunch of test
  files/directories.

  Run 'rockboxui'.

4. Target Keypad Equivalents

  The keyboard's numerical keypad is used to simulate the Archos keypads:

  Keyboard   Generic Archos
  --------   --------------
  +          ON
  8          UP
  2          DOWN
  4          LEFT
  6          RIGHT
             
  Keyboard   Recorder-only
  --------   --------------
  Enter      OFF
  5          PLAY
  /          F1
  *          F2
  -          F3

  Keyboard   Player-only
  --------   --------------
  Enter      MENU
  6          PLAY  (there's no separation between PLAY and RIGHT)
