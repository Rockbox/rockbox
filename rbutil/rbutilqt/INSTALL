This is Rockbox Utility, the graphical installer and housekeeping utility
for Rockbox.

Requirements:
=============
- gcc
- Qt 4.5.0 or later
- at least the following folders from Rockbox svn:
  o lib/rbcodec/codecs/libspeex
  o rbutil/
  o tools/
- libusb (Linux only)

Building:
=========
- run qmake
- run make

Build Options:
==============
- static
  add "-config static" to the qmake call to build a static binary. Note that
  this also requires that you have a statically built version of Qt.
- dbg
  add "-config dbg" to build with debug symbols.
- silent
  add "-config silent" to the qmake call. This is an undocumented feature of
  Qt itself. Note that this doesn't seem to work on Windows and Mac OS X until
  recent versions of Qt.

Installation / Deployment:
==========================
Rockbox Utility is build as all-in-one binary. This means for distribution
you need:
- RockboxUtility (main binary)
- rbutil_*.qm (translation files, only for non-static builds)
You don't need any other files like configuration files, especially
rbutil.ini which will get included into the binary.

The script utils/common/deploy-rbutil.py automates building deployment
binaries. For a complete list of paths to get from svn to build please check
its source.
