"You are a small green ball sitting in a grid full of obstacles. Your "
"aim is to collect all the gems without running into any mines. "
"\n"
"You can move the ball in any orthogonal _or diagonal_ direction. "
"Once the ball starts moving, it will continue until something stops "
"it. A wall directly in its path will stop it (but if it is moving "
"diagonally, it will move through a diagonal gap between two other "
"walls without stopping). Also, some of the squares are `stops'; when "
"the ball moves on to a stop, it will stop moving no matter what "
"direction it was going in. Gems do _not_ stop the ball; it picks "
"them up and keeps on going. "
"\n"
"Running into a mine is fatal. Even if you picked up the last gem in "
"the same move which then hit a mine, the game will count you as dead "
"rather than victorious. "
"\n"
"This game was originally implemented for Windows by Ben Olmstead "
"[11], who was kind enough to release his source code on request so "
"that it could be re-implemented for this collection. "

"\n#24.1 Inertia controls "
"\n"
"You can move the ball in any of the eight directions using the "
"numeric keypad. Alternatively, if you click the left mouse button "
"on the grid, the ball will begin a move in the general direction of "
"where you clicked. "
"\n"
"If you use the `Solve' function on this game, the program will "
"compute a path through the grid which collects all the remaining "
"gems and returns to the current position. A hint arrow will appear "
"on the ball indicating the direction in which you should move to "
"begin on this path. If you then move in that direction, the arrow "
"will update to indicate the next direction on the path. You can "
"also press Space to automatically move in the direction of the hint "
"arrow. If you move in a different direction from the one shown "
"by the arrow, arrows will be shown only if the puzzle is still "
"solvable. "
"\n"
"All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available. In "
"particular, if you do run into a mine and die, you can use the Undo "
"function and resume playing from before the fatal move. The game "
"will keep track of the number of times you have done this. "
