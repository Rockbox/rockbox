"#Chapter 4: Cube "
"\n"
"This is another one I originally saw as a web game. This one was a "
"Java game [2], by Paul Scott. You have a grid of 16 squares, six of "
"which are blue; on one square rests a cube. Your move is to use the "
"arrow keys to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that it moves to "
"an adjacent square. If you roll the cube on to a blue square, the "
"blue square is picked up on one face of the cube; if you roll a blue "
"face of the cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down "
"again. (In general, whenever you roll the cube, the two faces that "
"come into contact swap colours.) Your job is to get all six blue "
"squares on to the six faces of the cube at the same time. Count your "
"moves and try to do it in as few as possible. "
"\n"
"Unlike the original Java game, my version has an additional feature: "
"once you've mastered the game with a cube rolling on a square grid, "
"you can change to a triangular grid and roll any of a tetrahedron, "
"an octahedron or an icosahedron. "

"\n"
"\n#4.1 Cube controls "
"\n"
"This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse. "
"\n"
"Left-clicking anywhere on the window will move the cube (or other "
"solid) towards the mouse pointer. "
"\n"
"The arrow keys can also used to roll the cube on its square grid in "
"the four cardinal directions. On the triangular grids, the mapping "
"of arrow keys to directions is more approximate. Vertical movement "
"is disallowed where it doesn't make sense. The four keys surrounding "
"the arrow keys on the numeric keypad (`7', `9', `1', `3') can be "
"used for diagonal movement. "
"\n"
"(All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.) "
"\n"
"\n#4.2 Cube parameters "
"\n"
"These parameters are available from the `Custom...' option on the "
"`Type' menu. "
"\n"
"_Type of solid_ "
"\n"
"Selects the solid to roll (and hence the shape of the grid): "
"tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, or icosahedron. "
"\n"
"_Width / top_, _Height / bottom_ "
"\n"
"On a square grid, horizontal and vertical dimensions. On a "
"triangular grid, the number of triangles on the top and bottom "
"rows respectively. "
