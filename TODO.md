Building this project is probably quite fussy.

Improve the portability and reliability of this project's build process by:
* creating a Dockerfile that stands up an ideal build machine for this project
* adding a build command that builds the Rockbox file(s) using the aforementioned Dockerfile
* neatly outputs all relevant build artifacts to a gitignored build directory
* include a clean command (or update the existing one) to clean up the build dir
